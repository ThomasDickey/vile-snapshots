</PRE><H2 id="h2-DESCRIPTION-toc"><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>       <I>vile</I>  is  a  text  editor.   This  man  page  is  fairly  terse.   More
       information  can be obtained from the internal help, available with the
       <B>-h</B> option or by using the ":help" command from within <I>vile</I>.

       <I>xvile</I> is the same text editor, built as an X-windows application,  with
       fully integrated mouse support, scrollbars, etc.

       <I>uxvile</I>  is a wrapper around <I>xvile</I> which invokes the latter program with
       the correct locale environment required to use a unicode character  set
       and the "UXVile" X resource class set.

       <I>lxvile</I>  is a wrapper around <I>xvile</I> which invokes the latter program with
       a font chosen to match the current locale environment.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-SPIRIT-toc"><a name="h2-SPIRIT">SPIRIT</a></H2><PRE>       <I>vile</I> retains the "finger-feel" if you will, of  <I>vi</I>,  while  adding  the
       multiple  buffer  and  multiple  window  features  of  emacs  and other
       editors.  It is definitely not a vi clone,  in  that  some  substantial
       stuff  is  missing,  and  the  screen doesn't look quite the same.  The
       things that you tend to type over and over probably work.  Things  done
       less  frequently,  like  configuring  a  startup file, are somewhat (or
       very, depending on how ambitious you are) different.  But what  matters
       most  is that one's "muscle memory" does the right thing to the text in
       front of you, and that is what <I>vile</I> tries to do for vi users.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-OPTIONS-toc"><a name="h2-OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></H2><PRE>       Vile accumulates most options into two temporary buffers <I>[vileinit]</I> and
       <I>[vileopts]</I>.   The former is executed before reading the first file into
       a buffer.  The latter is executed after reading the first file  into  a
       buffer.  Each is removed after executing (unless an error is detected).

</PRE><H3 id="h3-COMMON-OPTIONS-toc"><a name="h3-COMMON-OPTIONS">COMMON OPTIONS</a></H3><PRE>       -c<I>command</I>
              <I>vile</I> will begin the session on the first file invoking the given
              command.  Legal commands include many ex-style  commands,  vile-
              commands,  etc.,  subject to shell quoting.  This option is used
              most often with a line number or search pattern.  For example

                 vile -c123 filename
                 vile -c/pattern filename

              They correspond to ex-style commands on the given file:

                 :123
                 :/pattern

              These are more verbose equivalents:

                 vile -c'123 goto-line' filename
                 vile -c'search-forward /pattern/' filename

              You can use more than one command, e.g.,

                 vile -c'123' -c'10*goto-col' filename

              to put the cursor on column 10 of  line  123.   The  "*"(or  ":"
              separates  the repeat count (used by <I>goto-col</I>) from the line- or
              range-specification used by line-oriented commands.

       @<I>cmdfile</I>
              <I>vile</I> will run the specified file as its startup file,  and  will
              bypass  any  normal  startup file (i.e.  <I>.vilerc</I>) or environment
              variable (i.e.  <I>$VILEINIT</I>).  This is added to <I>[vileinit]</I>.

       -D     tells <I>vile</I> to trace the results  of  macro  execution  into  the
              hidden buffer "[Trace]".

       -e | -E
              Invokes  <I>vile</I>  in  "noview"  mode - changes are permitted to any
              buffer while in this mode (see "-v".

       -F     will run the syntax filter that applies to each filename on  the
              command-line,  and  write  the  attributed  text to the standard
              output.

       -h     Invokes <I>vile</I> on the  helpfile.   See  "-?"  for  a  short  usage
              message.

       -i | -I
              Tells  <I>vile</I>  to  use  <I>vileinit.rc</I>  (which  is  installed) as the
              initialization file.  If you do not have a  .vilerc,  <I>vile</I>  will
              make  a  short  one  that  sources  <I>vileinit.rc</I> This is added to
              <I>[vileinit]</I>.

       -k <I>cryptkey</I> | -K <I>cryptkey</I>
              Specifies an encryption/decryption key.  See below  for  further
              discussion.   This  option  applies  only locally to the buffers
              named on the command-line, and is not added to <I>[vileopts]</I>, since
              that is executed too late.

       -R     Invokes  <I>vile</I> in "readonly" mode - no writes are permitted while
              in this mode.  (This will also be true if  <I>vile</I>  is  invoked  as
              <I>view</I>, or if "readonly" mode is set in the startup file.)

       -s <I>pattern</I> | -S <I>pattern</I>
              In  the  first file, <I>vile</I> will execute an initial search for the
              given pattern.  This is not the same as "-c/<I>pattern</I>" since  that
              positions  the  cursor  to  the line matching the pattern.  This
              option positions the cursor within the line.

       -t <I>tag</I>
              <I>vile</I> will edit the correct file  and  move  the  cursor  to  the
              location  of the tag.  This requires a tagsfile created with the
              <B>ctags(1)</B> command.  The option -T is equivalent, and can be  used
              when X11 option parsing eats the -t.

       -U     overrides the $system-crlf variable, making new buffers start in
              dos mode.

       -u     overrides the $system-crlf variable, making new buffers start in
              nodos mode.

       -v     Invokes  <I>vile</I>  in  "view" mode - no changes are permitted to any
              buffer while in this mode (see "-e".

       -V     <I>vile</I> will report its version number.

       -?     If an option is not recognized (or the  special  option  "?"  is
              given),  <I>vile</I>  prints  a  short usage message.  Normally that is
              sent to the standard output.   The  GUI  <I>winvile</I>  displays  this
              information in a window.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-SCREENSIZE-OPTIONS-toc"><a name="h3-SCREENSIZE-OPTIONS">SCREENSIZE OPTIONS</a></H3><PRE>       Screensize can be set from the command line for certain configurations:

       -25 -43 -50 -60
              On  PC  systems  you  may  be  able  to  set  the initial screen
              resolution from the command line.

       -80 -132
              On VMS systems you  may  be  able  to  set  the  initial  screen
              resolution from the command line.  See <I>vile.hlp</I> for details.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-X11-OPTIONS-toc"><a name="h3-X11-OPTIONS">X11 OPTIONS</a></H3><PRE>       <I>xvile</I>-specific  command-line options are detailed in the help file (see
       "Standard  X  command  line  arguments".   The  standard  ones   (e.g.,
       -display, -fn, -geometry, -name, etc.) are all supported.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-OBSOLETE-OPTIONS-toc"><a name="h3-OBSOLETE-OPTIONS">OBSOLETE OPTIONS</a></H3><PRE>       vile  recognizes  some options which duplicate the functionality of the
       POSIX "-c" option:

       +<I>command</I>
              This has the same effect as "-c<I>command</I>"

       -g <I>NNN</I> | -G <I>NNN</I>
              This has the same effect as "-c<I>NNN</I>" <I>vile</I> will begin the  session
              on the first file jumping to the given line number <I>NNN</I>.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-INVOCATION-toc"><a name="h2-INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a></H2><PRE>       vile  will  edit  the files specified on the command line.  If no files
       are specified, and standard input is not connected to a terminal,  then
       vile  will  bring  up  a buffer containing the output of the pipe it is
       connected to, and will re-open /dev/tty for  commands.   Files  (except
       for  the  first) are not actually read into buffers until "visited" All
       buffers are kept in memory: machines with not much memory or swap space
       may have trouble with this.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-STARTUP-toc"><a name="h2-STARTUP">STARTUP</a></H2><PRE>       If  the <I>@</I>cmdfile option is given, then the file given as "cmdfile" will
       be run before any files are loaded.  If no <I>@</I>  option  appears,  startup
       commands will be taken from the user's <I>VILEINIT</I> variable, if it is set,
       from the file <I>.vilerc</I> in the current directory, if it exists,  or  from
       <I>$HOME/.vilerc</I>,  as  a  last  resort.  See the help file for examples of
       what sorts of things might go into these command files.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-COMMANDS-toc"><a name="h2-COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></H2><PRE>       Please refer to  the  help  available  within  <I>vile</I>  for  <I>vile</I>-specific
       commands.   (That  document,  however,  assumes  familiarity  with vi.)
       Short descriptions of each  <I>vile</I>  command  may  be  obtained  with  the
       ":describe-function" and ":describe-key" commands.  All commands may be
       listed with ":show-commands"

       Additional documentation on writing macros using the internal scripting
       language can be found in the file <I>macros.doc</I>, distributed with the vile
       source.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-RELATED-PROGRAMS-toc"><a name="h2-RELATED-PROGRAMS">RELATED PROGRAMS</a></H2><PRE></PRE><H3 id="h3-xvile-toc"><a name="h3-xvile">xvile</a></H3><PRE>       <I>vile</I> may also be built and installed as <I>xvile</I>, in which case it behaves
       as  a  native  X  Windows  application,  with  scrollbars, better mouse
       support, etc.

       The help file has more information on this  in  the  section  <I>X</I>  <I>Window</I>
       <I>System</I> <I>specifics</I>.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-vile-manfilt-toc"><a name="h3-vile-manfilt">vile-manfilt</a></H3><PRE>       There  is  a  program distributed with the vile source which is usually
       installed as <I>vile-manfilt</I>.  It may be used in conjunction with <I>vile</I>  or
       <I>xvile</I>  (with  the  help of the macros in the file manpage.rc) to filter
       and view system manual pages.  <I>xvile</I> will  even  (with  your  font  set
       properly)  display  certain portions of the manual page text in bold or
       italics as appropriate.

       See the help file section on <I>Filtering</I> <I>"man"</I> <I>pages</I> for details.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-Syntax-filters-toc"><a name="h3-Syntax-filters">Syntax filters</a></H3><PRE>       Likewise, there are several language filters, e.g., <I>vile-c-filt</I> for  C,
       which  can  embolden,  underline, or perform coloring on program source
       code.

       Again,  see  the  help  file  section  on  <I>Syntax</I>  <I>Coloring</I>  for   more
       information.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-UTILITY-SCRIPTS-toc"><a name="h2-UTILITY-SCRIPTS">UTILITY SCRIPTS</a></H2><PRE>       Vile  is not simply an interactive program.  Its macro language and use
       of environment variables lets it be useful in scripting.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-vile-libdir-path-toc"><a name="h3-vile-libdir-path">vile-libdir-path</a></H3><PRE>       The syntax filters and <I>vile-manfilt</I> may  not  be  installed  where  you
       would  execute them in your <B>PATH</B>.  The <I>vile-libdir-path</I> script looks in
       the usual places and  prints  an  updated  <B>PATH</B>  variable  which  other
       scripts can use when executing these programs.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-vile-pager-toc"><a name="h3-vile-pager">vile-pager</a></H3><PRE>       Vile  can  be used as a <I>pager</I> (typical examples include <I>more</I> and <I>less</I>).
       This script uses <I>vile-manfilt</I> to preprocess a file which  is  piped  to
       vile, adding markup which vile displays properly.

       Unlike  a  typical  pager,  <I>vile-pager</I>  handles multi-line color escape
       sequences, and multiple levels of overstrikes.  But  unlike  a  typical
       pager,  <I>vile-pager</I>  expects  the  pipe  to  be  closed before it starts
       displaying.

</PRE><H3 id="h3-vile-to-html-toc"><a name="h3-vile-to-html">vile-to-html</a></H3><PRE>       Vile's "-F"  option  makes  it  act  like  a  smart  interface  to  the
       collection  of  syntax  filters.   But  its output uses vile's internal
       markup rather than standard escape sequences.  Vile's utilities include
       programs which translate that markup into different formats:

       <I>atr2ansi</I>
              converts the markup to ANSI escape sequences.

       <I>atr2html</I>
              converts the markup to HTML (with color).

       <I>atr2text</I>
              converts the markup to plain text.

       The  <I>vile-to-html</I> script uses <I>atr2html</I> to convert a text file into HTML
       using color.

</PRE><H2 id="h2-ENCRYPTION-toc"><a name="h2-ENCRYPTION">ENCRYPTION</a></H2><PRE>       The program <I>vile-crypt</I> can be used to encrypt/decrypt files  using  the
       same  algorithm as <I>microEmac</I>'s internal crypt algorithm.  This program,
       which uses public domain code written by Dana  Hoggatt,  is  no  longer
       used in vile, though it is provided for compatibility.

       <I>vile</I>  currently  uses  the <I>crypt(3)</I> function for encryption/decryption,
       which is available on most Unix systems.  This  ensures  that  <I>vile</I>  is
       able  to  read  and  write files compatibly with vi (but not vim, which
       uses an different  algorithm  derived  from  info-zip).   The  editor's
       encryption/decryption key can be specified on the command line with "-k
       key" Text to be encrypted can be specified as filenames on the  command
       line, or provided as the standard input.

       On  systems with a getpass() library routine, the user will be prompted
       for the encryption key if it is not given  on  the  command  line.   To
       accommodate systems (such as linux) where the getpass() library routine
       is not interruptible from the keyboard, entering a  crypt-key  password
       which ends in ^C will cause the program to quit.

       See  the  help  file for more information on <I>vile</I>'s encryption support,
       including a discussion of a collection of macros  that  interface  with
       GNU's gpg package.
