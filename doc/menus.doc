                                  XVile Menus

   The Motif and Athena widget versions of xvile automatically support user
   configurable menus.


Search-Rules
------------
   If the environment variable XVILE_MENU is set, it contains the name of the
   rc file. Otherwise, the name ".vilemenu" is used. The name of the menu
   file is given in the variable "$menu-file". If it is not found, and is
   different from "vilemenu.rc", xvile looks for that file in the list of
   directories given in "$startup-path". The "vilemenu.rc" file is treated
   specially because it is the file installed from vile's distribution.


Format
------
   The file contains a series of lines whose first character denotes the type
   of entry, subsequent fields delimited by colon:

   C - cascade (actually pulldown). One field only is recognized, the menu
       heading.
   B - button (menu entry). The first field is the menu label. The second is
       the command which will be executed. If the command is a number, it is
       expanded into the vile command execute-macro-<number>.

       Besides the normal vile commands, the menu implements the following

       new_xvile - spawn a new copy of xvile.
       edit_rc - switch to a buffer with ".vilerc".
       parse_rc - source ".vilerc"
       edit_mrc - switch to a buffer with the menu rc file which was found,
       e.g., "$menu-file" or "vilemenu.rc".
   S - separator
   L - list buffers. Each time you select this menu entry, vile constructs a
       current list of the buffers, allowing you to switch to any buffer by
       selecting it from the menu. It has to be at the end of a menu, and
       only one is allowed.

       For the Motif version, the accelerators are constructed to correspond
       with the vile commands for switching buffers, e.g., _0, _1 ...

   Lines beginning with '"' or ';' are ignored. character. Lines beginning
   with '#', or text after a tab also are ignored, but we may drop this
   feature at some point, to make it more consistent with vile's macro files.

   The special keyword "cmd" tells the menu function to invoke the following
   keyword as a :-line command, so that commands which must solicit input
   will work properly.
