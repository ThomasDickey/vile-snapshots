OLE Automation Support                                             version 9.8
----------------------                                             -----------

                             OLE Automation Support

   Winvile can be built and configured to execute as an OLE Automation
   server. The following steps are required:
    1. build a version of winvile that supports OLE,
    2. configure winvile as a server, and
    3. use an OLE automation client to invoke and manipulate winvile.


Build Syntax
------------
   By default, winvile is _not_ built with OLE Automation enabled, but this
   command adds that feature:

     nmake -f makefile.wnt CFG=winvile OPT=ole-auto

   Or, if an embedded perl support is desired, use this syntax:

     nmake -f makefile.wnt CFG=winvile-with-perl OPT=ole-auto


Minimal Configuration
---------------------
   OLE Automation support is not available until the Windows registry has
   been updated with various configuration information. The simplest method
   of registration is to:

    1. copy winvile.exe to some directory in your PATH, and then
    2. execute this command:

         winvile -Or

   The second step registers winvile as an OLE automation server that will be
   launched (by a client) with _no_ command line options, which implies these
   server attributes:

     * editor geometry is 24 rows by 80 columns
     * default font is "system fixed", 12-point (crayola-sized :-) )
     * editor visible
     * a single server instance (i.e., no matter how many clients create a
       winvile server object, there will be at most one server instance).

   There are, however, a number of command line options that can be specified
   during registration and which subsequently affect the launched winvile
   server.


Registration Options
--------------------
   The complete registration syntax is:

     winvile -Or [-geometry <cols>x<rows>] [-multiple] [-invisible]
                 [{-font|-fn} <font_spec>]

   where:

   -geometry <cols>x<rows> specifies the editor's window geometry.
   -invisible              launched server(s) are invisible and must be made
                           visible via the application's Visible property.
   -multiple               each client creates a new, unique server instance.
   -font <font_spec>       specifies the editor's font

   where:

     <font_spec>  :== [<face>,]<size>[,<style>]
     <face>       :== font-name
     <size>       :== point size (as an integer)
     <style>      :== { bold | italic | bold-italic }

   Note 1: if <style> is unspecified, "normal" is assumed.
   Note 2: if <face> contains a comma escape it with '\'.
   Note 3: if <face> is omitted, the current font is modified.
   Note 4: if <face> contains spaces, delimit <font_spec> as appropriate for
           the current shell/desktop environment.
   Note 5: <face> must be fixed pitch. To obtain a list of all fixed pitch
           fonts on the current win32 host, invoke winvile and browse the
           "Font" dialog box accessible from the System menu (accelerator key
           is ALT+<space bar>+F).

     Example:       -font 'Letter Gothic,8'
     Example:       -fn r_ansi,8,bold

   Note that it's generally not necessary to specify the font or geometry
   when registering winvile because those parameters may be set in the vile
   startup file (vile.rc). See the vile help topic "Win32 specifics" for
   further information.


Example Automation Client Access
--------------------------------
   Perl Access

         use Win32::OLE;
         $vile = new Win32::OLE 'Winvile.Application';
         $vile->VileKeys(":show-bindings\n");
         $vile->{Visible} = 1;           # may not be necessary
         print "sleeping for 3 seconds\n";
         sleep(3);
         $vile->VileKeys(":buffer [unnamed]\n");
         $vile->VileKeys(":r c:/config.sys\n");
         sleep(3);
         print "killing vile\n";
         $vile->Quit();
         exit

   VB Access

         Private VileObj As Winvile.Application

         Private Sub Form_Load()
         Set VileObj = New Winvile.Application
         VileObj.Visible = True           ' may not be necessary
         VileObj.VileKeys (":help" + vbLf)
         End Sub

         Private Sub Quit_Click()
         VileObj.Quit                     ' Kill the server (winvile)
         End
         End Sub

wvwrap.exe -- WinVile WRAPper

   [ Note: Ed Henderson discovered this novel use of automation and wrote the
   original version of wvwrap.exe . Thanks, Ed! ]


Background
----------
   It's possible to modify the Windows registry such that any arbitrary
   utility appears on the Windows Explorer right mouse popup menu. To do so,
   use regedit to create the following entry in the registry:

         HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\<utility_name>\command

   Example:

         HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\winvile\command

   Next, give the "command" key the following (Default) value:

         <utility_name> "%1"

   An actual example:

         HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\winvile\command\winvile "%1"

   Once this registry entry is installed, then anytime the right mouse button
   is clicked on a file in Windows Explorer, "winvile" appears as a selection
   at the top of the popup menu. Choosing winvile from this menu launches the
   editor, which then opens the selected file. So far, so good. However, when
   multiple files are selected and winvile is launched via a right mouse
   click, Windows Explorer opens one instance of the editor per selected
   file. Most vile-aholics will find this behavior rather repugnant. However,
   if winvile is configured as a single server instance (the default), a
   workaround exists. Read on.

   When the Ole Automation version of winvile is built as described above, a
   utility called wvwrap.exe is also created. Copy wvwrap to a directory in
   your PATH and create the following registry entry:

         HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\wvwrap\command\wvwrap "%1"

   If using Windows XP, it's necessary to specify the full path to wvwrap, as
   shown here:

         HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\wvwrap\command\<full_path_to>wvwrap.exe "%1"

   Now, as a test, select multiple files within Window Explorers, right click
   the mouse, and launch wvwrap. Notice that all files are read into a single
   instance of winvile, one buffer per file.


Server Properties And Methods
-----------------------------
   Application               - [out] Returns the application object.
   ForegroundWindow()        - Makes the editor the foreground window. Note
                               that Windows 2000 and XP essentially
                               emasculated this method. See MainHwnd() for an
                               alternative approach.
   FullName                  - [out] Returns the path of the application.
   InsertMode                - [out] True if editor window with keyboard
                               focus is in insert mode.
   IsMinimized               - [out] True if editor minimized.
   MainHwnd                  - [out] Returns the editor's main window handle.
                               Useful if the client wishes to, say, call
                               SetForegroundWindow() on behalf of the editor.
   Minimize()                - Minimizes the editor.
   Name()                    - [out] Returns the name of the application.
   Parent()                  - Returns the parent of the application object.
   Quit()                    - Exits the editor.
   Restore()                 - Restores the editor's window.
   VileKeys([in] keys)       - Sends keystrokes to the editor. Note that this
                               method is implemented by using PostMessage()
                               to send a WM_CHAR message for _each_ character
                               in the "keys" string. In other words, this is
                               not an efficient method and should not be used
                               to create large files.
   Visible                   - [in, out] Sets or returns the editor's
                               visibility.
   WindowRedirect([in] hwnd) - Specifies a window handle to which
                               user-specified keystrokes are redirected.
                               Redirected keystrokes are specified via
                               winvile's "redirect-keys" mode. Refer to the
                               file visvile.doc for a detailed discussion of
                               this method and its associated mode.

                               To disable redirection once enabled, pass this
                               method a NULL window handle.

   Note: ForegroundWindow(), Minimize(), and Restore() implicitly force an
   Invisible server to the Visible state.


Unregistering The Server
------------------------
   To unregister winvile as an OLE automation server, execute this command:

     winvile -Ou
