  <h1 id="toplevel-id"><a name="toplevel" id="toplevel">VisVile --
  Developer Studio Support</a></h1>Within a limited context,
  winvile may be substituted as the default Developer Studio
  editor.

  <h2 id="prereqs-id"><a name="prereqs" id=
  "prereqs">Preconditions</a></h2>

  <ul>
    <li>You must be using Developer Studio version 5 (or later),
    which exposes OLE automation "hooks" that permit winvile to
    augment and/or replace the default editor. The implementation
    described within this document will not work with earlier
    versions of DevStudio.</li>

    <li>Obtain or build a version of winvile that supports OLE
    Automation. Register same. For further details, refer to the
    file <a href="oleauto.html">oleauto.doc</a>, stored in the same
    directory as this document. When reading <a href=
    "oleauto.html">oleauto.doc</a>, note that:

      <ul>
        <li>step 1 (building the editor) is optional if using
        pre-built versions of _both_ winvile.exe and
        visvile.dll&nbsp;.</li>

        <li>step 2 (configuring the editor as a server) is
        mandatory, and</li>

        <li>step 3 (manipulating winvile via an automation client)
        is described in great detail within this document
        :-)&nbsp;.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="installing-id"><a name="installing" id=
  "installing">Installation</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Obtain or build visvile.dll, a Developer Studio add-in that
    actually invokes winvile. To build visvile, follow these steps:

      <ol>
        <li>First build winvile using the syntax described in
        <a href="oleauto.html">oleauto.doc</a> . This is an
        important step, since the build process creates a file
        called winviletlb.h that is included by visvile.dll's
        sources.</li>

        <li>Use Developer Studio to open the visvile source
        directory as a project.</li>

        <li>Set the "active project configuration" (see the Build
        Menu) as "VisVile - Win32 Release".</li>

        <li>Press F7 (which builds visvile.dll in the Release
        subdirectory).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Copy Release/visvile.dll to a directory location of your
    choice. It may or may not be important for the destination
    directory to be a member of your PATH. On a Win95 host, it is
    not.</li>

    <li>On a WinNT host it may be necessary to formally register
    visvile.dll's type information in the Win32 registry (on a
    Win95 host it is not). Type registration is accomplished like
    so:

      <ol>
        <li>login to an account with Administrator rights,</li>

        <li>open a dos box,</li>

        <li>cd to the destination directory chosen in step 2
        above,</li>

        <li>execute this command:
          <pre>
   regsvr32 visvile.dll
</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Almost done :-) . Invoke Developer Studio and incorporate
    visvile.dll as an add-in using these steps:

      <ol>
        <li>Invoke the add-in dialog box via these menus:
          <pre>
          Tools
             Customize...
                Add-Ins and Macro Files
</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Click the Browse button and point Developer Studio at
        visvile.dll&nbsp;.</li>

        <li>Select visvile.dll (it will be registered as an
        add-in).</li>

        <li>Close the Customize dialog box.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>You should immediately notice a new VisVile Toolbar. Click
    the first toolbar icon to configure VisVile (configuration
    options and toolbar icons are discussed shortly).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>That's it. Now, every time Developer Studio is invoked,
  visvile.dll is automatically loaded as an add-in.</p>

      <td valign="top">Close DevStudio copy of text document</td>

      <td>VisVile closes DevStudio's copy of an open text document
      after winvile has opened its copy. This feature keeps
      DevStudio from issuing a warning message each time a project
      file is modified by an external editor. If unchecked, winvile
      and the DevStudio text editor co-exist side by side. But see
      the Caveats section below.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top">CWD set from opened document's path</td>

      <td>Winvile's current working directory is set to match the
      path of any document opened by VisVile.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top">Write all modified buffers to disk prior to
      build</td>

      <td>
        VisVile forces winvile to flush all modified buffers to
        disk before a DevStudio build begins. Note that DevStudio
        (v5, at least) decides which files must be compiled _prior_
        to notifying VisVile of an imminent build. This is arguably
        a DevStudio (v5) bug and it does diminish the usefulness of
        this option.

        <p>One workaround is to press the build accelerator key
        (F7) twice for each build. The first key press builds
        whatever files are out-of-date before modified winvile
        buffers are written to disk. The second key press forces
        DevStudio to re-examine its dependencies and build
        everything affected by the last winvile buffer flush.</p>

        <p>Another workaround is to become accustomed to typing :ww
        within winvile prior to starting a DevStudio build.</p>

      log (refer to the Tools-&gt;Customize-&gt;Build dialog box),
      then when the current DevStudio build reports errors or
      warnings, VisVile causes winvile to use the build log as its
      error buffer. In this configuration, the source code
      associated with each error/warning message may be directly
      accessed by simply typing ^X-^X. For a complete description
      of ^X-^X, browse vile's help and search for the string "error
      finder".</td>

      <td valign="top">Redirect selected Winvile keys to
      DevStudio</td>

      <td>Winvile redirects keystrokes specified in the
      "redirect-keys" mode to DevStudio. This option permits, for
      example, a single winvile keystroke to start a DevStudio
      build, execute the target application, or initiate
      application debugging. More will be said about this option
      near the end of this document.</td>

  <h2 id="studioops-id"><a name="studioops" id=
  "studioops">DevStudio Operations Affected By VisVile</a></h2>

  <p>When VisVile is enabled, any operation that causes DevStudio
  to open a text file will instead/also cause winvile to open that
  file. Note too that repeatedly pressing the F4 key within
  DevStudio following a failed build causes winvile to be
  positioned at the source code line(s) triggering error and/or
  warning messages. However, _each_ error or warning message
  accessed via the F4 key requires a manual switch between winvile
  and DevStudio. For that reason, the "Build log -&gt; errbuf..."
  option is much more convenient (no switching required).</p>

  <h2 id="toolbaricons-id"><a name="toolbaricons" id=
  "toolbaricons">Toolbar Icons</a></h2>

  <p>The first icon, bound to command name "VisVileConfigCmd",
  configures VisVile. The second and third icons provide shortcuts
  for enabling and disabling VisVile. Note that it makes sense to
  disable VisVile before debugging an application (otherwise, the
  debugger pops up winvile whenever a breakpoint is taken). These
  icons are bound to command names "VisVileEnableCmd" and
  "VisVileDisableCmd", respectively.</p>

  <p>The fourth icon, bound to command name "VisVileOpenDocCmd",
  forces winvile to unconditionally open the text document
  currently visible in the default text editor. This icon is often
  useful when VisVile is disabled.</p>

  <h2 id="keyboardaliases-id"><a name="keyboardaliases" id=
  "keyboardaliases">Keyboard Shortcuts</a></h2>

  <p>Use this menu hierarchy:</p>
  <pre>
      Tools
         Customize...
            Keyboard (category Add-ins)
</pre>

  <p>to assign DevStudio keyboard shortcuts to any of the command
  names mentioned in the previous section of this document.</p>

  <h2 id="donotforget-id"><a name="donotforget" id=
  "donotforget">Don't Forget These Details</a></h2>

  <p>+ DevStudio sends VisVile a "document opened" event _only_ if
  the affected document is not currently open in the default
  editor. Keep this fact in mind when configuring the "Close
  DevStudio copy of text document" option. This restriction does
  not apply to the fourth toolbar icon. + It makes sense to disable
  VisVile before debugging an application (otherwise, the debugger
  pops up winvile whenever a breakpoint is taken).</p>

  <h2 id="controllingit-id"><a name="controllingit" id=
  "controllingit">Controlling DevStudio From Winvile</a></h2>

  <p>Initially, VisVile was created so that various DevStudio
  events caused winvile to execute text editing commands on behalf
  of the IDE. In other words, DevStudio controlled winvile. But
  given the rich interprocess communication mechanisms available in
  the Win32 environment, it became obvious that once DevStudio
  established an OLE connection wtih winvile, the editor could turn
  the tables and manipulate its OLE client :-) .</p>

  <p>To that end, when winvile is compiled as an OLE Automation
  server, a new mode called "redirect-keys" is available. This mode
  specifies a list of keystrokes that are to be redirected to
  DevStudio. The list must be in the following format:</p>
  <pre>
        &lt;keyspec&gt;,...
</pre>

  <p>where</p>
  <pre>
        &lt;virt_key&gt;:[&lt;modifier&gt;...]:[&lt;action&gt;...]
</pre>

  <p>and</p>

  <h2 id="augmentingit-id"><a name="augmentingit" id=
  "augmentingit">Augmenting Winvile Control With DevStudio
  Macros</a></h2>

  <p>We're almost set. For example, we can now start the debugger
  from winvile by simply pressing F5. Or, we might use winvile to
  position a source file at a desired breakpoint location and then
  press F9 to actually set the breakpoint in DevStudio's debugger.
  Neat. But wouldn't it be great if we could disable VisVile before
  starting the debugger so that breakpoints don't cause DevStudio
  to switch focus back to winvile? This is possible, but requires
  an assist from a small macro (written in Visual Basic). Included
  with the VisVile source distribution is a macro file called
  VisVile.dsm that includes assists for the redirected F5, F7, F9,
  F10, and F11 keys. The F5, F9, F10, and F11 macros simply disable
  VisVile prior to executing DevStudio's DebugGo,
  DebugToggleBreakpoint, DebugStepOver, and DebugStepInto commands,
  respectively. The F7 macro is a bit more complicated, but each of
  its actions are documented. Notice that VisVile.dsm doesn't
  include assist macros for Ctrl+F5, which makes sense, because
  target application execution does not require disabling
  VisVile.</p>

  <p>Our final configuration task, then, is to modify DevStudio so
  that it executes Visvile.dsm's macros when the F5, F7, F9, F10,
  and F11 keys are pressed. We want control flow established like
  so (using the F10 key as an example):</p>
  <pre>
        Winvile User Presses F10
               ||
               \/
        DevStudio Message Pump
               ||
               \/
        Visvile.dsm's F10 Macro Executed
               ||
               \/
        VisVile Disabled
               ||
               \/
        DevStudio's DebugStepOver Command Executed
</pre>

  <p>To achieve the desired objective, follow this recipe:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Navigate this menu hierarchy: Tools Customize... Add-ins
    and Macro Files</li>

    <li>Use the Browse button to find, open, and load visvile.dsm
    .</li>

    <li>Now navigate using this menu hierarchy:
      <pre>
      Tools
         Customize...
            Keyboard
                Category
                    Macros
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Next, use the "Commands" drop-down box to select the "F10"
    macro. In the same dialog box context, use the "Editor"
    drop-down box to select "Main" and then enter F10 (by pressing
    F10 on the keyboard) as the new shortcut key. Be sure to click
    the Assign button or your actions will be lost.

      <p>As a side effect of this sequence, the standard DevStudio
      F10 shortcut (available from the Debug Menu) will be deleted.
      Finally, in the same dialog box context, use the "Editor"
      drop-down box to select "Text" and again enter F10 as a new
      shortcut key (and don't forget to click the Assign
      button).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Repeat the last step for the F5, F7, F9, and F11 macros.</p>

  <p>At this point it's probably a good idea to close DevStudio and
  re-invoke. After checking to ensure that VisVile.dll and
  VisVile.dsm are still installed as add-ins and also ensuring that
  your new shortcuts are in place, test the winvile redirection
  feature as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>open a buildable project and enable Visvile.</li>

    <li>configure VisVile so that the "Redirect selected Winvile
    keys to DevStudio" option is checked.</li>

    <li>perform some action that causes DevStudio to invoke winvile
    (for example, double click on a filename in the file view
    pane).</li>

    <li>with window focus directed to winvile, press F7. If the
    aforementioned configuration is correct, DevStudio will begin
    building the selected project.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If nothing happens when the F7 key is pressed, chances are
  good that DevStudio was not configured to direct the F7 key to
  the F7 assist macro for both the "Main" and "Text" editors.</p>

  <h2 id="uninstallingit-id"><a name="uninstallingit" id=

  <ol>
    <li>Invoke Developer Studio, invoke the Add-Ins and Macro Files

    information, open a dos box, cd to the destination directory
    chosen in installation step 2 above, and execute this command:
