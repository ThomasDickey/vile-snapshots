                      VisVile -- Developer Studio Support
                      ===================================
Within a limited context, winvile may be substituted as the default
Developer Studio editor.


Preconditions
=============
+ You must be using Developer Studio version 5 (or later), which exposes
  OLE automation "hooks" that permit winvile to augment and/or replace the
  default editor.  The implementation described within this document will
  not work with earlier versions of DevStudio.

+ Obtain or build a version of winvile that supports OLE Automation.
  Register same.  For further details, refer to the file oleauto.doc,
  stored in the same directory as this document.  When reading oleauto.doc,
  note that:

  - step 1 (building the editor) is optional if using pre-built versions
    of _both_ winvile.exe and visvile.dll .

  - step 2 (configuring the editor as a server) is mandatory, and

  - step 3 (manipulating winvile via an automation client) is described
    in great detail within this document :-) .


Installation
============
1) Obtain or build visvile.dll, a Developer Studio add-in that actually
   invokes winvile.  To build visvile, follow these steps:

   a) First build winvile using the syntax described in oleauto.doc .
      This is an important step, since the build process creates a file
      called winviletlb.h that is included by visvile.dll's sources.

   b) Use Developer Studio to open the visvile source directory as a
      project.

   c) Set the "active project configuration" (see the Build Menu) as
      "VisVile - Win32 Release".

   d) Press F7 (which builds visvile.dll in the Release subdirectory).

2) Copy Release/visvile.dll to a directory location of your choice.
   It may or may not be important for the destination directory to be a
   member of your PATH.  On a Win95 host, it is not.

3) On a WinNT host it may be necessary to formally register visvile.dll's
   type information in the Win32 registry (on a Win95 host it is not).
   Type registration is accomplished like so:

   a) login to an account with Admin rights,
   b) open a dos box,
   c) cd to the destination directory chosen in step 2 above,
   d) execute this command:    regsvr32 visvile.dll

4) Almost done :-) .  Invoke Developer Studio and incorporate visvile.dll
   as an add-in using these steps:

   a) Invoke the add-in dialog box via these menus:

          Tools
             Customize...
                Add-Ins and Macro Files

   b) Click the Browse button and point Developer Studio at visvile.dll .
   c) Select visvile.dll (it will be registered as an add-in).
   d) Close the Customize dialog box.

5) You should immediately notice a new VisVile Toolbar.  Click the first
   toolbar icon to configure VisVile (configuration options and toolbar
   icons are discussed shortly).

That's it.  Now, every time Developer Studio is invoked, visvile.dll is
automatically loaded as an add-in.


Configuration Options
=====================

Option Name       Explanation
-----------       -----------
Add-in enabled    VisVile causes winvile to open any new or existing _text_
                  document accessed by DevStudio, provided that the default
                  editor doesn't already have that document open (see next
                  option).

Close DevStudio copy of text document
                  VisVile closes DevStudio's copy of an open text document
                  after winvile has opened its copy.  This feature keeps
                  DevStudio from issuing a warning message each time a
                  project file is modified by an external editor.  If
                  unchecked, winvile and the DevStudio text editor co-exist
                  side by side.  But see the Caveats section below.

CWD set from opened document's path
                  Winvile's current working directory is set to match the
                  path of any document opened by VisVile.

Write all modified buffers to disk prior to build
                  VisVile forces winvile to flush all modified buffers to
                  disk before a DevStudio build begins.  Note that
                  DevStudio (v5, at least) decides which files must be
                  compiled _prior_ to notifying VisVile of an imminent
                  build.  This is arguably a DevStudio (v5) bug and it does
                  diminish the usefulness of this option.

                  One workaround is to press the build accelerator key (F7)
                  twice for each build.  The first key press builds
                  whatever files are out-of-date before modified winvile
                  buffers are written to disk.  The second key press forces
                  DevStudio to re-examine its dependencies and build
                  everything affected by the last winvile buffer flush.

                  Another workaround is to become accustomed to typing :ww
                  within winvile prior to starting a DevStudio build.

Build log -> errbuf if build reports errs/warnings
                  Assuming DevStudio has been configured to create an error
                  log (refer to the Tools->Customize->Build dialog box),
                  then when the current DevStudio build reports errors or
                  warnings, VisVile causes winvile to use the build log as
                  its error buffer.  In this configuration, the source code
                  associated with each error/warning message may be
                  directly accessed by simply typing ^X-^X.  For a complete
                  description of ^X-^X, browse vile's help and search for
                  the string "error finder".

Redirect selected Winvile keys to DevStudio
                  Winvile redirects keystrokes specified in the
                  "redirect-keys" mode to DevStudio.  This option permits,
                  for example, a single winvile keystroke to start a
                  DevStudio build, execute the target application, or
                  initiate application debugging.  More will be said about
                  this option near the end of this document.


DevStudio Operations Affected By VisVile
========================================
When VisVile is enabled, any operation that causes DevStudio to open a text
file will instead/also cause winvile to open that file.  Note too that
repeatedly pressing the F4 key within DevStudio following a failed build
causes winvile to be positioned at the source code line(s) triggering error
and/or warning messages.  However, _each_ error or warning message accessed
via the F4 key requires a manual switch between winvile and DevStudio.  For
that reason, the "Build log -> errbuf..." option is much more convenient
(no switching required).


Toolbar Icons
=============
The first icon, bound to command name "VisVileConfigCmd", configures VisVile.

The second and third icons provide shortcuts for enabling and disabling
VisVile.  Note that it makes sense to disable VisVile before debugging an
application (otherwise, the debugger pops up winvile whenever a breakpoint
is taken).  These icons are bound to command names "VisVileEnableCmd" and
"VisVileDisableCmd", respectively.

The fourth icon, bound to command name "VisVileOpenDocCmd", forces winvile
to unconditionally open the text document currently visible in the default
text editor.  This icon is often useful when VisVile is disabled.


Keyboard Shortcuts
==================
Use this menu hierarchy:

      Tools
         Customize...
            Keyboard (category Add-ins)

to assign DevStudio keyboard shortcuts to any of the command names mentioned
in the previous section of this document.


Don't Forget These Details
==========================
+ DevStudio sends VisVile a "document opened" event _only_ if the affected
  document is not currently open in the default editor.  Keep this fact in
  mind when configuring the "Close DevStudio copy of text document" option.
  This restriction does not apply to the fourth toolbar icon.

+ It makes sense to disable VisVile before debugging an application
  (otherwise, the debugger pops up winvile whenever a breakpoint is taken).


Controlling DevStudio From Winvile
==================================
Initially, VisVile was created so that various DevStudio events caused
winvile to execute text editing commands on behalf of the IDE.  In other
words, DevStudio controlled winvile.  But given the rich interprocess
communication mechanisms available in the Win32 environment, it became
obvious that once DevStudio established an OLE connection wtih winvile, the
editor could turn the tables and manipulate its OLE client :-) .

To that end, when winvile is compiled as an OLE Automation server, a new
mode called "redirect-keys" is available.  This mode specifies a list of
keystrokes that are to be redirected to DevStudio.  The list must be in the
following format:

    <keyspec>,...

where

    <keyspec>     :== <virt_key>:[<modifier>...]:[<action>...],
    <virt_key>    :== virtual keycode macro name sans "VK_".  Refer to the
                      table near the end of this document for a list of
                      keycodes that may be redirected.
    <modifier>    :== S|C|A         <-- mnemonics for shift, control, alt
    <action>      :== <flush>|<switch>
    <flush>       :== F             <-- flush all modified buffers to disk
                                        prior to redirecting key
    <switch>      :== S             <-- switch focus to redirected window
                                        prior to redirecting key

The default list looks like so:

    F5::S,F10::S,F11::S,F7::F,F5:C:

which can be translated using this table:

    KeyStoke    Action         Standard DevStudio ShortCut Semantics
    --------    ------         -------------------------------------
    F5          Switch Focus   Run program under debugger
    F10         Switch Focus   Step over
    F11         Switch Focus   Step into
    F7          Flush buffers  Build application
    Ctrl+F5     <none>         Execute application


Augmenting Winvile Control With DevStudio Macros
================================================
We're almost set.  For example, we can now start the debugger from winvile
by simply pressing F5.  Neat.  But wouldn't it be great if we could disable
VisVile before starting the debugger so that breakpoints don't cause
DevStudio to switch focus back to winvile?  This is possible, but requires
an assist from a small macro (written in Visual Basic).  Included with the
VisVile source distribution is a macro file called VisVile.dsm that
includes assists for the redirected F5, F7, F10, and F11 keys.  The F5,
F10, and F11 macros simply disable VisVile prior to executing DevStudio's
DebugGo, DebugStepOver, and DebugStepInto commands, respectively.  The F7
macro is a bit more complicated, but each of its actions are documented.
Notice that VisVile.dsm doesn't include an assist macro for Ctrl+F5, which
makes sense, because target application execution is a standalone action
unaffected by the editor or the IDE.

Our final configuration task, then, is to modify DevStudio so that it
executes Visvile.dsm's macros when the F5, F7, F10, and F11 keys are pressed.
We want control flow established like so (using the F10 key as an example):

        Winvile User Presses F10
               ||
               \/
        DevStudio Message Pump
               ||
               \/
        Visvile.dsm's F10 Macro Executed
               ||
               \/
        VisVile Disabled
               ||
               \/
        DevStudio's DebugStepOver Command Executed

To achieve the desired objective, follow this recipe:

1) Navigate this menu hierarchy:

      Tools
         Customize...
            Add-ins and Macro Files

2) Use the Browse button to find, open, and load visvile.dsm .

3) Now navigate using this menu hierarchy:

      Tools
         Customize...
            Keyboard
                Category
                    Macros

4) Next, use the "Commands" drop-down box to select the "F10" macro.  In the
   same dialog box context, use the "Editor" drop-down box to select "Main"
   and then enter F10 (by pressing F10 on the keyboard) as the new shortcut
   key.  Be sure to click the Assign button or your actions will be lost.

   As a side effect of this sequence, the standard DevStudio F10 shortcut
   (available from the Debug Menu) will be deleted.  Finally, in the same
   dialog box context, use the "Editor" drop-down box to select "Text" and
   again enter F10 as a new shortcut key (and don't forget to click the
   Assign button).

Repeat step 4 for the F5, F7, and F11 macros.

At this point it's probably a good idea to close DevStudio and re-invoke.
After checking to ensure that VisVile.dll and VisVile.dsm are still
installed as add-ins and also ensuring that your new shortcuts are in
place, test the winvile redirection feature as follows:

1) open a buildable project and enable Visvile.
2) configure VisVile so that the "Redirect selected Winvile keys to DevStudio"
   option is checked.
3) perform some action that causes DevStudio to invoke winvile (for
   example, double click on a filename in the file view pane).
4) with window focus directed to winvile, press F7.  If the aformentioned
   configuration is correct, DevStudio will begin building the selected
   project.

If nothing happens when the F7 key is pressed, chances are good that
DevStudio was not configured to direct the F7 key to the F7 assist macro
for both the "Main" and "Text" editors.


Uninstalling VisVile
====================
1) Invoke Developer Studio, invoke the Add-Ins and Macro Files dialog
   box, and uncheck "Winvile Developer Studio Add-In".

2) If it was necessary to register visvile.dll's type information, open a dos
   box, cd to the destination directory chosen in installation step 2 above,
   and execute this command:    regsvr32 -unregister visvile.dll  .
