Major (and minor) modes in Vile
===============================

Goals
-----

This document describes the proposed implementation and use of major
modes in vile.  My goal is to extend the notion of the C mode (cmode)
to allow runtime definable major modes.

The C mode is a collection of modes that are useful for editing C
program source:

	c-suffixes
	c-tabstop
	c-shiftwidth

as well as builtin functionality:

	autoindention of C statements taking into account curly braces
	fence matching for /*...*/ comments and C preprocessor statements
	comment formatting

Both the modes and functionality are extensions of other features in
vile.  It would be useful to combine modes to support other languages
in a similar fashion.  Likewise, the autoindention, etc., could be
parameterized and made reusable to support other languages.  For an
initial implementation, I am focusing on the combining of modes,
providing a structure for the parameterization.

One thing that is not clear to many users (and possibly should be
changed) is the manner in which the C mode is attached to a buffer. 
It is currently set as a boolean - if active before a buffer is
loaded, then vile checks the file suffix to see if it matches the
c-suffixes mode, and if so, sets the C mode for the buffer.  C mode
can be explicitly set by a ":setl cmode", and unset by ":setl
nocmode".  In the new scheme,

	+ vile will search the list of all active majormodes, first
	  testing if any match with the majormode's suffixes, then if
	  any preamble (first line regular expression) matches.

	  The search is in normally alphabetic order, by majormode name. 
	  The first match each, of suffixes and preamble terminate the
	  search, but a match of preamble overrides a match of suffixes. 
	  Use "after" and "before" qualifiers to handle special cases.

	+ majormodes can be disabled (e.g., ":set nocmode"), as before.
	  However, there is no global sense of majormode; unsetting a
	  buffer's local value of a majormode simply makes it not have a
	  majormode associated with it.


Commands
--------

These are the commands which I think are necessary:

	define-majormode {majormode}

	define-submode {majormode} {minormode}[={value}]

	remove-majormode {majormode}

	remove-submode {majormode} {minormode}

The {majormode} is a new symbol.

The {minormode} can be any one of the existing buffer modes, except for
a {majormode}.  To make name-completion simple, we use the term 'submode'.


Example
-------

	define-majormode c
	; Declares a mode 'c', and corresponding symbol 'cmode'

	define-submode c suffixes=\\.\\(\\([Cchisyl]\\)\\|CC\\|cc|cpp\\|cxx\\|hxx\\|scm\\)$
	; Specifies the filename suffixes which control whether a newly-loaded
	; buffer is set to 'c' mode.

	define-submode c tabstops=4
	define-submode c shiftwidth=4
	; Defines the 'c' tabstops and shiftwidth.  If no "define-submode"
	; command is given, no separate symbol is defined.

As an example, to define a new major mode for perl programming, you might
include the following in your .vilerc file:

	define-majormode perl
	define-submode perl preamble "^#.*perl\\>"
	define-submode perl suffixes "\\.pl$"
	define-submode perl shiftwidth 4


The "define-majormode" command
------------------------------

This takes a single argument, a majormode name.  To follow existing
convention, the string "mode" is automatically appended to the given
name.  Associated modes are defined or modified with the define-submode
command.  Vile maintains a list of majormodes.  Only one majormode can
be associated with a buffer (none need be associated).  After
definition, a majormode can be set or unset just like any other buffer
mode:

	define-majormode c
	; defines "cmode"

	set cmode
	; sets the default mode for new buffers

	setl cmode
	; sets the mode for the current buffer

	setl nocmode
	; clear c mode (existing implementation)

	unsetl cmode
	; clear c mode (not currently implemented)

The restriction to a single majormode is because mode values are
internally represented as structures with a pointer.  The pointer
denotes which value (currently local or global) is used.  The
majormode implementation adds a level to this, e.g.,

	value -> self (local)
	value -> global (global)
	value -> major (majormode)

When a majormode is defined, an array of the existing minor mode values
is allocated, all pointing to the global modes.  The define-submode
command modifies these to make them local pointers.  When a buffer is
associated with a majormode, all of its buffer mode values are pointed
to the majormode's values.  (To keep the bookkeeping straight, modifying
a global buffer mode must also modify the copies of non-local buffer
mode values).


The "define-submode" command
----------------------------

This command sets local values of buffer modes for the given majormode,
e.g.,

	define-submode c autoindent

The majormode name is required.  Any number of modes can be modified
in a single command.

The following are keywords that aren't minor modes, but are recognized
solely by the define-submode command:

	suffixes
		The filename suffix which is tested to trigger
		association with a majormode (e.g., c-suffixes)

		Note that since the default value for the c-suffixes mode
		is a regular expression that will match some other file
		types (C++ files, for instance), if you define a new major
		mode for one of those suffixes you may want to reset
		c-suffixes to something less inclusive.

	preamble
		Regular expression, matched against the beginning of a
		file (the first line) used to trigger association with
		a majormode (e.g., "^!#.*\/perl[^a-z]").

	before
	after
		A string that tells vile how to rank the majormode. 
		Normally vile checks each mode in order by name, but there
		are special cases where you may want to check one mode
		before another.  For example, the C++ majormode cppmode
		would be checked after cmode, but that uses suffixes which
		are a subset of the built-in cmode's suffixes and would not
		be found.  So cppmode is qualified before="c".

	group
		followed by a name, defines an alternative set of submode
		values.
		
		Currently used only for complex fences, this could be applied
		to simple fences, and (with new flags not yet defined) extend
		both styles of fences for indentation and formatting.

	fences
		These are "complex" fences, which are matched one expression
		per line.  The names are "fence-" followed by any of the
		following keywords with a regular expression:
		
			if, elif, else, fi

		Vile searches through all groups of complex fences for a
		match before trying simple fences.

	comments
		These are "simple" fences, which can be matched any number
		of times per line.  The pairs need not appear on the same
		line.  Like complex fences, they have an implied order.
		The default values support C-style comments, with the '%' going
		between "/*" and "*/".  The names use "fence-" followed any of
		the following keywords with a regular expression:  begin, end.

	indent	(not implemented)
		The keyword "cstyle", or any of the following keywords
		with a regular expression: begin, end, if, then, else,
		elif, endif.

Other features which should be controlled by majormodes include limiting
the scope of the entab and detab commands.


The "remove-majormode" command
------------------------------

This command has two forms:

	remove-majormode {majormode}

		This removes the definition of the majormode.  Buffers
		that were associated with the mode revert to no
		majormode.

or
	remove-majormode {majormode} {name}

		This removes the value of {name} from {majormode},
		leaving it set to the global value, if any.


The "remove-submode" command
----------------------------

Remove the special association of a submode from a majormode.

Example
-------

The builtin C/C++ majormode description is equivalent to

define-mode c
~with define-submode c
	suffix "\\.\\(\\([Cchisyl]\\)\\|CC\\|cc|cpp\\|cxx\\|hxx\\|scm\\)$"
	comment-prefix="^\\s*\\(\\s*[#*>]\\)\\+"
	comments="^\\s*/\\?\\(\\s*[#*>]\\)\\+/\\?\\s*$"
	fence-begin="/\\*"
	fence-end="\\*/"
	fence-if="^\\s*#\\s*if"
	fence-elif="^\\s*#\\s*elif\\>"
	fence-else="^\\s*#\\s*else\\>"
	fence-fi="^\\s*#\\s*endif\\>"

Note that the following are equivalent once you have defined the majormode "c":
	set cts=8
	set c-tabstop=8
	define-submode c tabstop=8
