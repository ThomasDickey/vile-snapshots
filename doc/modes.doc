                        Major (and minor) modes in Vile

   This document was originally written in May, 1998, and has been updated
   periodically to reflect the proposed implementation of and use of major
   modes in vile.

   My goal was to extend the notion of the C mode (cmode) to allow runtime
   definable major modes.

   Originally, vile supported a C mode that included a collection of modes
   useful for editing C program source:

     * c-suffixes
     * c-tabstop
     * c-shiftwidth

   as well as this builtin functionality:

     * autoindention of C statements taking into account curly braces
     * fence matching for /*...*/ comments and C preprocessor statements
     * comment formatting

   Both the modes and functionality are extensions of other features in vile.
   It would be useful to combine modes to support other languages in a
   similar fashion. Likewise, the autoindention, etc., could be parameterized
   and made reusable to support other languages. For an initial
   implementation, I focused on the combining of modes, providing a structure
   for the parameterization.

   One thing that was not clear to many users was the manner in which the C
   mode was attached to a buffer. It was set as a boolean - if active before
   a buffer was loaded, then vile checked the file suffix to see if it
   matched the c-suffixes mode, and if so, set the C mode for the buffer. C
   mode could also be explicitly set by a ":setl cmode", and unset by ":setl
   nocmode". In the new scheme,

     * vile searches the list of all active majormodes, first testing if any
       match with the majormode's suffixes, then if any preamble (first line
       regular expression) matches.

       The search is in normally alphabetic order, by majormode name. The
       first match each, of suffixes and preamble terminate the search, but a
       match of suffixes overrides a match of preamble. Use "after" and
       "before" qualifiers to handle special cases.

       In rare circumstances, both suffixes and preamble are needed to
       distinguish a given mode from another. Use

             qualifiers=all

       to specify this. The default, "qualifiers=any", allows either suffixes
       or preamble to determine the majormode.

       The suffixes and preamble rules can be overridden altogether by
       specifying $majormode-hook to a script which sets the majormode for
       the current buffer.

     * majormodes can be disabled (e.g., ":set nocmode"), as before. However,
       there is no global sense of majormode; unsetting a buffer's local
       value of a majormode simply makes it not have a majormode associated
       with it.


Commands
--------
   These are the commands which I originally thought necessary:

     * define-majormode {majormode}
     * define-submode {majormode} {minormode}[={value}]
     * remove-majormode {majormode}
     * remove-submode {majormode} {minormode}
     * setl {majormode}
     * setl no{majormode}

   The {majormode} is a new symbol.

   The {minormode} can be any one of the existing buffer modes, except for a
   {majormode}. To make name-completion simple, we use the term 'submode'.

   Later, I added features to make majormodes simpler to configure:

     * "~with" in the scripting language prefixes text.
     * derive-majormode {newmode} {oldmode}

  Example

         define-majormode c
         ; Declares a mode 'c', and corresponding symbol 'cmode'

         define-submode c suffixes="\\.\\(\\([Cchisyl]\\)\\|CC\\|cc|cpp\\|cxx\\|hxx\\|scm\\)$"
         ; Specifies the filename suffixes which control whether a newly-loaded
         ; buffer is set to 'c' mode.

         define-submode c tabstop=4
         define-submode c shiftwidth=4
         ; Defines the 'c' tabstop and shiftwidth.  If no "define-submode"
         ; command is given, no separate symbol is defined.

   As an example, to define a new major mode for perl programming, you might
   include the following in your .vilerc file:

         define-majormode perl
         define-submode perl preamble "^#.*perl\\>"
         define-submode perl suffixes '\.\(pm\|t\)$'
         define-submode perl shiftwidth 4

   To avoid the tediousness of this syntax, use the ~with and ~endwidth
   keywords, like so:

         define-majormode perl
         ~with define-submode perl
             preamble "^#.*perl\\>"
             suffixes '\.\(pm\|t\)$'
             shiftwidth 4
         ~endwith

   You can define several regions using ~with and (after the first) ~elsewith
   blocks. Each block specifies a set of tokens which are substituted at the
   beginning of each line. Each ~elsewith block should have a group
   identifier to distinguish it from the others. The reason for providing
   multiple blocks is to implement complex fence-matching for different
   language features.

   For example, in the definition of cshmode, the symbols "fence-XXX" give
   patterns which vile can use to move the cursor from one if/elif/else/fi
   marker to the next as you press "%". The other settings such as "suf" in
   the first block are settings that apply to the majormode itself:

         define-mode csh
         ~with define-submode csh
             suf '\.\(csh[^/]*\|login\|logout\)$'
             pre '^#!\s*\/.*csh\>\(\s*-[a-z]\+\)*\s*$'
             filtername  'vile-sh-filt -k csh'
             comment-prefix      '^\s*#'
             comments    '^\s*#\s*$'
             fence-if    '^\s*\<if\>.*\<then\>'
             fence-elif  '^\s*\<else\s*if\>'
             fence-else  '^\s*\<else\>'
             fence-fi    '^\s*\<endif\>'
         ~elsewith define-submode csh group 'case'
             fence-if    '^\s*\<switch\>\s*(.*)'
             fence-elif  '^\s*\<case\>.*:'
             fence-else  '^\s*\<default\>\s*:'
             fence-fi    '^\s*\<endsw\>'
         ~elsewith define-submode csh group 'loop'
             fence-if    '^\s*\<foreach\s\+.*\|while\>\s*(.*)'
             fence-fi    '^\s*\<end\>'
         ~endwith

  The "define-majormode" command

   This takes a single argument, a majormode name. To follow existing
   convention, the string "mode" is automatically appended to the given name.
   Associated modes are defined or modified with the define-submode command.
   Vile maintains a list of majormodes. Only one majormode can be associated
   with a buffer (none need be associated). After definition, a majormode can
   be set or unset just like any other buffer mode:

         define-majormode c
         ; defines "cmode"

         setl cmode
         ; sets the mode for the current buffer

         setl nocmode
         ; clear c mode (existing implementation)

         unsetl cmode
         ; clear c mode

   The restriction to a single majormode is because mode values are
   internally represented as structures with a pointer. The pointer denotes
   which value (currently local or global) is used. The majormode
   implementation adds a level to this, e.g.,

         value -> self (local)
         value -> global (global)
         value -> major (majormode)

   When a majormode is defined, an array of the existing minor mode values is
   allocated, all pointing to the global modes. The define-submode command
   modifies these to make them local pointers. When a buffer is associated
   with a majormode, all of its buffer mode values are pointed to the
   majormode's values. (To keep the bookkeeping straight, modifying a global
   buffer mode must also modify the copies of non-local buffer mode values).

  The "derive-majormode" command

   This is used to clone an existing majormode, using a new name. The command
   takes two parameters:

    1. the new majormode name
    2. the old majormode name, used as a source of settings

   If the new majormode already exists, it is not removed. Instead, settings
   are copied from the old majormode into the existing majormode. In
   principle, a series of these commands could be used to merge several
   different majormodes.

  The "define-submode" command

   This command sets local values of buffer modes for the given majormode,
   e.g.,

         define-submode c autoindent

   The majormode name is required. The names after the majormode name are
   names of buffer modes with a corresponding value. Any number of modes can
   be specified in a single command, e.g.,

         define-submode c autoindent tabstop=4

   For each mode given, vile defines corresponding names by which they can be
   referenced, e.g., "c-autoindent" (from the long mode name "autoindent")
   and "cai" (from the short mode name "ai" for autoindent). The long mode
   name is always appended with a hyphen, and the short mode name is appended
   without a hyphen.

   The term "submode" is used in the command rather than the more natural
   "minor mode" to simplify name-completion.

   The following are keywords that aren't minor modes, but are recognized
   solely by the define-submode command:

   mode-pathname
           The full pathname which is tested to trigger association with a
           majormode, e.g., "RCS/*,v".

   mode-filename
           The filename which is tested to trigger association with a
           majormode, e.g., "Makefile".

   suffixes
           The filename suffix which is tested to trigger association with a
           majormode (e.g., c-suffixes) Note that since the default value for
           the c-suffixes mode is a regular expression that will match some
           other file types (C++ files, for instance), if you define a new
           major mode for one of those suffixes you may want to reset
           c-suffixes to something less inclusive.

   preamble
           Regular expression, matched against the beginning of a file (the
           first line) used to trigger association with a majormode (e.g.,
           "^!#.*\/perl[^a-z]").

   filtername
           A shell command telling which filter to call, and how to do that.
           The form of the command is limited, since it is interpreted for
           internal calls:

         {filter} {options}

           where {filter} is the filename for the filter, e.g.,

         vile-c-filt

           and options include:

                -k mode
                        The keyword filename, omitting ".keywords". For
                        instance, the C filter vile-c-filt is used for C,
                        C++, JavaScript and Java by changing the keyword
                        file.

                -q
                        Quit after loading the keyword definitions.

                -t tabs
                        Set the tabstops, used in the imake filter to check
                        for coincidental matches between a tab and spaces
                        that are the same number of columns.

                -v

                -vv
                        Debug traces, mainly to show which keyword files are
                        loaded, and what information is parsed from them.

           Other options may be implemented that are specific to a filter
           program. For instance, vile-c-filt recognizes a -p option to mark
           preprocessor lines with an error (used for Java).

   before

   after
           A string that tells vile how to rank the majormode. Normally vile
           checks each mode in order by name, but there are special cases
           where you may want to check one mode before another. For example,
           the C++ majormode cppmode would be checked after cmode, but that
           uses suffixes which are a subset of the built-in cmode's suffixes
           and would not be found. So cppmode is qualified before="c".

   group
           followed by a name, defines an alternative set of submode values.

           Currently used only for complex fences, this could be applied to
           simple fences, and (with new flags not yet defined) extend both
           styles of fences for indentation and formatting.

   fences
           These are "complex" fences, which are matched one expression per
           line. The names are "fence-" followed by any of the following
           keywords with a regular expression:

         if, elif, else, fi

           Vile searches through all groups of complex fences for a match
           before trying simple fences.

   comments
           These are "simple" fences, which can be matched any number of
           times per line. The pairs need not appear on the same line. Like
           complex fences, they have an implied order. The default values
           support C-style comments, with the '%' going between "/*" and
           "*/". The names use "fence-" followed any of the following
           keywords with a regular expression: begin, end.

   indent (not implemented)
           The keyword "cstyle", or any of the following keywords with a
           regular expression: begin, end, if, then, else, elif, endif.

   Other features which should be controlled by majormodes include limiting
   the scope of the entab and detab commands.

  The "remove-majormode" command

   This command has two forms:

   remove-majormode {majormode}
           This removes the definition of the majormode. Buffers that were
           associated with the mode revert to no majormode.

   or

   remove-majormode {majormode} {name}
           This removes the value of {name} from {majormode}, leaving it set
           to the global value, if any.

  The "remove-submode" command

   Remove the special association of a submode from a majormode.

  Example

   The original builtin C/C++ majormode description is equivalent to

         define-mode c
         ~with define-submode c
                 suffix "\\.\\(\\([Cchisyl]\\)\\|CC\\|cc|cpp\\|cxx\\|hxx\\|scm\\)$"
                 comment-prefix="^\\s*\\(\\s*[#*>]\\)\\+"
                 comments="^\\s*/\\?\\(\\s*[#*>]\\)\\+/\\?\\s*$"
                 fence-begin="/\\*"
                 fence-end="\\*/"
                 fence-if="^\\s*#\\s*if"
                 fence-elif="^\\s*#\\s*elif\\>"
                 fence-else="^\\s*#\\s*else\\>"
                 fence-fi="^\\s*#\\s*endif\\>"
                 cindent
         ~endwith

   Note that the following are equivalent once you have defined the majormode
   "c":

         set cts=8
         set c-tabstop=8
         define-submode c tabstop=8
