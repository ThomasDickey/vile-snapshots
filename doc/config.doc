                           Configuring vile and xvile

   This file describes the steps which are needed to configure and make
   either vile or xvile. See the file README for a blurb on what (x)vile is
   and how great it is :-). The file INSTALL contains generic information on
   the process of configuring and building programs which (more or less)
   conform to the GNU coding standards. You might want to consult that
   document for more information.


Building vile
-------------
   To build vile, enter the following command from your shell:

         ./configure; make

   If you'd like to examine makefile and config.h prior to making, split
   these steps up as follows:

         ./configure
         make

   If you are unfortunate enough to be running on a platform in which some
   part of the above process does not work perfectly, you might well want to
   modify makefile to add references to obscure libraries or non-standard
   library locations.

   [ At least one version of bash running on Linux (and perhaps other)
   systems will cause the configure script to produce invalid results.
   Specifically, if you're running version 1.14.3 of bash consider upgrading
   to a newer one. ]

   Modifying makefile is not recommended because your changes will be lost
   should you run configure again. Many configuration options can be set
   externally to the configure script or the makefile. For instance, if you'd
   like to change some of the flags passed to the C compiler, try doing it
   like this:

         make CFLAGS=-O2

   Or, this can be done when running the configure script instead -- try:

         CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure                  (sh, ksh, bash)

   or:

         (setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure)       (csh)

   Then again, a configure script argument is shell-agnostic:

         ./configure --with-cflags=-O2

   If you need to suppress your optimizer (which is invoked as -O by
   default), because it's known to be buggy, use CFLAGS=" ". [ One
   combination thought to be buggy is AIX 3.2.5 with gcc 2.6.0. ]

   The configure script will favor using gcc on your system if available.
   This is usually fine, but if gcc was not installed correctly (or your
   environment isn't quite right), it can be disastrous. You can override the
   choice of compiler with:

         CC=cc ./configure               (sh, ksh, bash)

   or:

         (setenv CC cc ; ./configure)    (csh)

   Likewise, extra link libraries can be added by setting them in LIBS before
   running configure.


Screen Types
------------
   Vile is configured and built with a terminal driver. At this time, only
   one driver is built with vile at a time. Some other editors attempt to
   combine more than one driver in the default configuration, making the
   resulting program much larger and slower. We will ultimately modify vile
   to support multiple drivers, but the default configuration will be the
   smallest and fastest.

   Use the configure script's "--with-screen" option to specify the driver
   type, e.g.,

         ./configure --with-screen=tcap

   The default configuration for vile uses termcap (or terminfo, depending
   what your system has available). The configuration script tests several
   possibilities. Your system may have more than one library to link against,
   e.g., on Linux you may have both termcap and ncurses (a terminfo-based
   system). If you wish to use color, you are generally better off using
   terminfo, since termcap descriptions usually are limited to a fixed size,
   and some features are omitted.

   A curses interface is provided as well:

         ./configure --with-screen=curses

   To tell the configure script to link against the ncurses library (using
   the curses.c driver), type

         ./configure --with-screen=ncurses

   A much less capable driver uses builtin ANSI escape sequences:

         ./configure --with-screen=ansi


Syntax coloring options
-----------------------
   Adding syntax coloring to the editor can be simple or not.

  Fast, simple syntax coloring

   Maximally efficient syntax coloring can be selected by specifying this
   configure command line:

         --with-builtin-filters

   An ensuing build binds _all_ of the editor's syntax coloring filters into
   the resultant executable. On the plus side, the build options are simple
   and since no filters are invoked externally (via a pipe), syntax coloring
   is executed with minimal overhead. On the minus side, this configure
   option generates a much larger executable.

  Slower, simple syntax coloring

   Omitting any variant of the --with-builtin-filters option or specifying
   "--with-builtin-filters=none" ensures that all of the editor's syntax
   coloring filters are created as separate, external executables. On the
   plus side, this choice minimizes the editor's footprint. However, external
   filters are invoked via a pipe, which is substantially slower than the
   direct execution model.

  Complex syntax coloring

   vile also supports a mix of both internal and external filters, which
   facilitates configuration of the editor with as few or as many internal
   filters as desired. But before describing how this is achieved, note the
   breadth of the following table of editor filter names and language
   mappings:

   xs          vile-xs-filt    Perl extension source files
   yacc        vile-yacc-filt  yacc and bison

   As you might expect, when the "--with-builtin-filters" option is selected,
   all of the internal filters listed above are bound into the editor. "Hey,
   wait a minute", you say, "I'll never use some of those filters--not in a
   hundred years." In that case, use this configure syntax:

         --with-builtin-filters="<filter_list>"

   For example:

         ./configure --with-cflags=-O2 \
                     --with-builtin-filters="awk c key lex m4 perl sed tags
                     diff html mail make pl rcs sh sql tbl tcl txt vile yacc"
         make
         make install

   The above commands:
     * compile vile [1],
     * compile and link 21 filters into the final editor image,
     * create the remaining, non-builtin filters as external executable
       images, and
     * copy the editor and external filters to an to an install tree [2].
   Assuming the editor's startup file initiates syntax coloring [3], then at
   vile run time, the macro file filters/filters.rc preferentially selects
   and executes internal filters when coloring a supported language or file
   format. If a required internal filter is not available, filters.rc starts
   a pipe and applies color attributes via the corresponsing external filter
   listed in the table above.

Building xvile
--------------
   You must decide which version of xvile you want to build. To a certain
   degree this decision may be forced upon you by which libraries you have on
   your machine. There are three different versions you can build.
    1. X toolkit version: This version uses only the X toolkit to implement
       scrollbars and the window resize grips (meaning _vile_ windows, not X
       windows). As a consequence, it should only require the X toolkit
       library (-lXt) and the Xlib library (-lX11). (Don't worry if you don't
       know what these are or where these are; the configuration script will
       probably be able to find them.) The scrollbars in this version look
       much like those found in a standard xterm. We recommend that you try
       this version out first as it is superior in some respects to the other
       versions which use fancy widget sets. To configure this version, enter
       the following command:

         ./configure --with-screen=x11

       A minor variation using the Athena widgets supports menus:

         ./configure --with-screen=Xaw

       Two other variations on the Athena widgets are provided:

         ./configure --with-Xaw3d

       to link with Xaw 3d library

         ./configure --with-neXtaw

       to link with neXT Athena library. There's little functional difference
       between the three versions of Athena libraries, they provide different
       appearance. You can also configure with the corresponding scrollbars
       from the Athena library (though we are not as satisfied with their
       performance, particularly with resizing):

         ./configure --with-Xaw-scrollbars

       to use Xaw scrollbars rather than our own (applies to all variations
       of Athena library). You can also use Kevin's dragging/scrolling logic
       with the Athena library:

         ./configure --with-drag-extension

    2. Motif version: This version uses the Motif widget set to implement the
       scrollbars and (vile) window resize pane. To configure the Motif
       version, enter one of the following commands (several variations are
       recognized for each screen value to simplify integration with other
       scripts):

         ./configure --with-screen=motif
         ./configure --with-screen=Xm

    3. OpenLook version: Uses the OpenLook widgets to implement scrollbars.
       Since OpenLook lacks a pane widget, resizing (vile) windows is pretty
       cheesy. Still, if you are running olwm or olvwm, you might well want
       to run this version so that xvile will look the same as your other
       applications.

         ./configure --with-screen=openlook
         ./configure --with-screen=Xol

       After configuration, you may look at the makefile or config.h if you
       wish. You can finish making xvile by entering the following command:

         make

       On some systems it seems to be sometimes necessary (?) to have X_LIBS
       set to -static prior running configure, i.e, use either:

         X_LIBS=-static ./configure --with-screen=openlook

       for sh, ksh, and bash. Or:

         (setenv X_LIBS -static ; ./configure --with-screen=openlook)

       for csh and tcsh.


Installing (x)vile
------------------
   Installation of (x)vile is simple. Obtain the appropriate privileges
   (become superuser if necessary), and enter the following command:

         make install

   If you have ever installed an older version of vile, you should probably
   check to be sure the old help files are gone. They used to go to a
   different place (by default) than they do now. It can be most confusing to
   use an older version of the help file with a newer version of the program,
   and unfortunately, older help files didn't have version numbers.

   By default, (x)vile and the script "vile-pager" are installed in
   /usr/local/bin. Other editor components are stored in these directories:

          component             install dir
   vile.hlp                /usr/local/share/vile
   vile.1 (man page)       /usr/local/man/man1
   syntax coloring filters [note 1]
   coloring keyword files  /usr/local/share/vile
   various macro files     /usr/local/share/vile

   Note 1: the value of the environment variable VILE_LIBDIR_PATH specifies
   where configure installs external coloring filters. If unset, configure
   defaults to /usr/local/lib/vile.

   We realize that not everyone has superuser privileges on the machines on
   which they wish to build (x)vile. If you lack superuser access or write
   access to /usr/local, you will want to change the installation location.
   You may do so by using the --prefix option to "configure". Suppose you
   wish to have xvile installed in $HOME/bin (your home bin directory). You
   would issue the following commands:

     ./configure --with-screen=x11 --prefix=$HOME
     make install

   The file INSTALL has more information on installation and on configure's
   --prefix option. If you don't feel like rebuilding (likely), you can also
   edit the makefile and change the "prefix", "bindir", or "libdir"
   definitions--but remember that your changes will be lost the next time
   configure is run.


Building in a separate directory
------------- ------------------
   If you are building (x)vile for several machines or want to perhaps
   simultaneously build and try out the various versions of xvile, you will
   probably want to configure (x)vile to build in a directory different from
   where the source resides. This requires that you have make program which
   correctly uses the VPATH variable. GNU make does this well, others may or
   may not.

   Suppose that the source resides in vile-src. At the same level as
   vile-src, you might perhaps create a directory called vile-x11-sunos to
   indicate that you are building xvile on a platform running sunos. You
   would then cd into this directory and issue the following configuration
   command:

         ../vile-src/configure --with-screen=x11

   Another directory at the same level as vile-src might be named vile-sunos
   to indicate that you are building vile on a platform running sunos. After
   you cd into this directory, you'd then issue the following command to
   configure ordinary vile.

         ../vile-src/configure

   The "make" step in each case is the same as described above; you simply
   issue the command:

         make

   to finish making (x)vile.

   This process is described in more formally in the INSTALL document. As
   described there, you will need to use a version of "make" which supports
   the VPATH variable. And it must support it _correctly_. Again, GNU make
   does this. A lot of older "make"s don't.


Other Compile-Time Options
--------------------------
   Aside from the screen type, most functionality in vile is controlled by
   the "OPT_" #ifdef's in the estruct.h file. Some of the more useful ones
   (or those that require manipulating the makefile) are also provided as
   configure options:

   --with-exec-macros=N    specify count of numbered macros  (anachronism)
   --with-perl             enable use of Perl as an extension language


Testing/Development Options
---------------------------
   Several other options appear in the configure script's "--help" message.
   They are used to support testing and development, by building various
   debug versions of vile. These include:

   --disable-echo          test: display "compiling" commands (default: on)
   --disable-extensions    test: build only core functions (default: on)
   --disable-shell         test: disable shell/external commands (default: on)
   --with-dbmalloc         test: use Conor Cahill's dbmalloc library
   --with-dmalloc          test: use Gray Watson's dmalloc library
   --with-no-leaks         test: free permanent memory, analyze leaks
   --with-trace            test: turn on debug-tracing
   --with-warnings         test: turn on GCC compiler warnings

   The dbmalloc and dmalloc libraries are similar, checking for memory leaks
   and related malloc/free problems. Both have limitations, so we use both,
   as well as other tools such as Purify and ElectricFence, according to the
   problem.

   The --with-no-leaks option compiles in code that frees all of the
   permanently allocated memory on exit. This greatly simplifies the task of
   analyzing memory leaks.

   The --with-trace option turns on debug traces that go to the Trace.out
   file. Since vile is a fullscreen program, it is not useful to write
   messages to the screen. (The OPT_HEAPSIZE option is an exception; you may
   be amused by it).

   The --with-warnings option applies mostly to compiles with GCC, since it
   is available across several platforms. We build with all available
   compilers, but their warnings options are not consistent.

   Because the echoed commands in the makefile are long, the --disable-echo
   option is provided to shorten the commands, making it easy to see the
   warnings.

   The --disable-extensions and --disable-shell options are for testing.
   Disabling extensions produces a smaller program, essentially the core of
   vile (no macros), which is a workable editor. You may wish to build vile
   without shell support, but perhaps not (ymmv).
