  <h1 id="toplevel-id"><a name="toplevel" id="toplevel">Configuring
  vile and xvile</a></h1>

  <p>This file describes the steps which are needed to configure
  and make either vile or xvile. See the file README for a blurb on
  what (x)vile is and how great it is :-). The file INSTALL
  contains generic information on the process of configuring and
  building programs which (more or less) conform to the GNU coding
  standards. You might want to consult that document for more
  information.</p>

  <h2 id="building-id"><a name="building" id="building">Building
  vile</a></h2>

  <p>To build vile, enter the following command from your
  shell:</p>
  <pre>
        ./configure; make
</pre>

  <p>If you'd like to examine makefile and config.h prior to
  making, split these steps up as follows:</p>
  <pre>
        ./configure
        make
</pre>

  <p>If you are unfortunate enough to be running on a platform in
  which some part of the above process does not work perfectly, you
  might well want to modify makefile to add references to obscure
  libraries or non-standard library locations.</p>

  <p>[ At least one version of bash running on Linux (and perhaps
  other) systems will cause the configure script to produce invalid
  results. Specifically, if you're running version 1.14.3 of bash
  consider upgrading to a newer one. ]</p>

  <p>Modifying makefile is not recommended because your changes
  will be lost should you run configure again. Many configuration
  options can be set externally to the configure script or the
  makefile. For instance, if you'd like to change some of the flags
  passed to the C compiler, try doing it like this:</p>
  <pre>
        make CFLAGS=-O2
</pre>

  <p>Or, this can be done when running the configure script instead
  -- try:</p>
  <pre>
        CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure                  (sh, ksh, bash)
</pre>

  <p>or:</p>
  <pre>
        (setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure)       (csh)
</pre>

  <p>Then again, a configure script argument is shell-agnostic:</p>
  <pre>
        ./configure --with-cflags=-O2
</pre>

  <p>If you need to suppress your optimizer (which is invoked as -O
  by default), because it's known to be buggy, use CFLAGS=" ". [
  One combination thought to be buggy is AIX 3.2.5 with gcc 2.6.0.
  ]</p>

  <p>The configure script will favor using gcc on your system if
  available. This is usually fine, but if gcc was not installed
  correctly (or your environment isn't quite right), it can be
  disastrous. You can override the choice of compiler with:</p>
  <pre>
        CC=cc ./configure               (sh, ksh, bash)
</pre>

  <p>or:</p>
  <pre>
        (setenv CC cc ; ./configure)    (csh)
</pre>

  <p>Likewise, extra link libraries can be added by setting them in
  LIBS before running configure.</p>

  <h2 id="screentypes-id"><a name="screentypes" id=
  "screentypes">Screen Types</a></h2>

  <p>Vile is configured and built with a terminal driver. At this
  time, only one driver is built with vile at a time. Some other
  editors attempt to combine more than one driver in the default
  configuration, making the resulting program much larger and
  slower. We will ultimately modify vile to support multiple
  drivers, but the default configuration will be the smallest and
  fastest.</p>

  <p>There are several types of terminal driver:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>text terminals</li>

    <li>X Window displays</li>

    <li>Win32 displays, when building in MSYS for MinGW</li>

    <li>Special displays, e.g., for OS/2</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The configure script provides an option for selecting a text,
  X Window or even Win32 display. Use the "--with-screen" option to
  specify the driver type, e.g.,</p>
  <pre>
        ./configure --with-screen=tcap
</pre>

  <p>Some of the choices use mixed-case, e.g., "Athena". The
  configure script also recognizes the lowercase form of each of
  those names, in this instance "athena".</p>

  <h3 id="textdrivers-id"><a name="textdrivers" id=
  "textdrivers">Text Terminal Drivers</a></h3>

  <p>There are several choices, listed here in their order of
  capabilities:</p>

  <p>--with-screen=ncursesw<br>
  --with-screen=tcap (default)<br>
  --with-screen=ncurses<br>
  --with-screen=curses<br>
  --with-screen=ansi</p>

  <p>The default configuration for vile uses termcap (or terminfo,
  depending on what your system has available). That is the default
  because it is the most widely available. The "ncursesw"
  configuration provides better optimization of the terminal's
  capabilities, e.g., for scrolling and combining video attributes.
  Most users would not see a difference between the two
  choices.</p>

  <p>The configuration script tests several possibilities for each
  choice. Your system may have more than one library to link
  against, e.g., on Linux you may have both termcap and ncurses (a
  terminfo-based system). If you wish to use color, you are
  generally better off using terminfo, since termcap descriptions
  usually are limited to a fixed size, and some features are
  omitted. The termcap databases also tend to not be as
  well-maintained as their terminfo counterparts.</p>

  <p>In addition to "ncursesw", two other forms of "curses" driver
  are supported:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>curses</li>

    <li>ncurses</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They both use the same driver source, but "ncurses" tells the
  configure script to look for the ncurses library, which may not
  be the default curses implementation on your machine. Like
  "ncursesw", these can provide better optimization of the terminal
  than the termcap/terminfo driver.</p>

  <p>The "ansi" driver is the least capable. It uses built-in ANSI
  escape sequences.</p>

  <p>The "--with-ncurses" option is used as a special case of the
  default termcap/terminfo driver, to ensure that it uses the
  ncurses library rather than a termcap-only library.</p>

  <h3 id="x11drivers-id"><a name="x11drivers" id="x11drivers">X
  Window Drivers</a></h3>

  <p>There are several choices, again listed in</p>

  <p>--with-screen=Motif<br>
  --with-screen=Athena<br>
  --with-screen=Xaw<br>
  --with-screen=Xaw3d<br>
  --with-screen=neXtaw<br>
  --with-screen=X11</p>

  <p>The Motif display has the nicest appearance. The one drawback
  (relative to Athena) is that dragging the separator between
  window panes is done on the scrollbar. The Athena interface
  allows you to drag the separator by clicking on the status-line
  of a window, and moving the mouse.</p>

  <p>"Athena" and "Xaw" are the same; the two values are given to
  make the script simpler to use. The "Xaw", "Xaw3d" and "neXtaw"
  choices are almost the same, choosing libraries that have the
  same capabilities but different appearances.</p>

  <h3 id="w32drivers-id"><a name="w32drivers" id="w32drivers">Win32
  Drivers</a></h3>

  <p>If you are building vile in the MSYS environment, i.e.,
  compiling for MinGW, you can build "convile" or "minvile" instead
  of the text- or X-choices:</p>

  <p>--with-screen=DOS<br>
  --with-screen=Windows</p>

  <p>The "DOS" and "Windows" choices are comparable in
  functionality to the executables built using Visual C++.</p>

  <h2 id="utf8drivers-id"><a name="utf8drivers" id=
  "utf8drivers">UTF-8 Support versus Driver</a></h2>

  <p>vile supports UTF-8 in two ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>it edits UTF-8 data as characters rather than bytes
    and</li>

    <li>it can display UTF-8 data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The ability to manipulate UTF-8 data depends on the operating
  system and your locale settings. The ability to display UTF-8
  data depends on the terminal driver. If the terminal driver is
  unable to render UTF-8 data, vile displays it using "\u"
  sequences.</p>

  <p>In the choices for <a href="#textdrivers">text-drivers</a>,
  ncursesw is before tcap and ncurses after because of their
  support for UTF-8 The "ncurses" library supports 8-bit encodings,
  and cannot display UTF-8. Both "ncursesw" and the
  termcap/terminfo drivers can display UTF-8, as long as your
  locale settings support it.</p>

  <p>The X Window drivers all support UTF-8. Currently that is for
  single-width characters (in contrast to the text- and Win32
  drivers). There is no support (yet) for combining characters.</p>

  <p>Win32 drivers support UTF-8. But they display based on font
  selection. The "Lucida Console" font is widely available, and can
  be used for this purpose. To have complete support for UTF-8, you
  need the fonts provided with Microsoft Office.</p>

  <h2 id="syntaxopts-id"><a name="syntaxopts" id=
  "syntaxopts">Syntax coloring options</a></h2>

  <p>Adding syntax coloring to the editor can be simple or not.</p>

  <h3 id="fastsyntax-id"><a name="fastsyntax" id="fastsyntax">Fast,
  simple syntax coloring</a></h3>

  <p>Maximally efficient syntax coloring can be selected by
  specifying this configure command line:</p>
  <pre>
        --with-builtin-filters
</pre>

  <p>An ensuing build binds _all_ of the editor's syntax coloring
  filters into the resultant executable. On the plus side, the
  build options are simple and since no filters are invoked
  externally (via a pipe), syntax coloring is executed with minimal
  overhead. On the minus side, this configure option generates a
  much larger executable.</p>

  <h3 id="simplesyntax-id"><a name="simplesyntax" id=
  "simplesyntax">Slower, simple syntax coloring</a></h3>

  <p>Omitting any variant of the --with-builtin-filters option or
  specifying "--with-builtin-filters=none" ensures that all of the
  editor's syntax coloring filters are created as separate,
  external executables. On the plus side, this choice minimizes the
  editor's footprint. However, external filters are invoked via a
  pipe, which is substantially slower than the direct execution
  model.</p>

  <h3 id="complexsyntax-id"><a name="complexsyntax" id=
  "complexsyntax">Complex syntax coloring</a></h3>

  <p>vile also supports a mix of both internal and external
  filters, which facilitates configuration of the editor with as
  few or as many internal filters as desired. But before describing
  how this is achieved, note the breadth of the following table of
  editor filter names and language mappings:</p>

  <p>As you might expect, when the "--with-builtin-filters" option
  is selected, all of the internal filters listed above are bound
  into the editor. "Hey, wait a minute", you say, "I'll never use
  some of those filters--not in a hundred years." In that case, use
  this configure syntax:</p>
  <pre>
        --with-builtin-filters="&lt;filter_list&gt;"
</pre>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <pre>
        ./configure --with-cflags=-O2 \
                    --with-builtin-filters="awk c key lex m4 perl sed tags
                    diff html mail make pl rcs sh sql tbl tcl txt vile yacc"
        make
        make install
</pre>

  <p>The above commands:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>compile vile [1],</li>

    <li>compile and link 21 filters into the final editor
    image,</li>

    <li>create the remaining, non-builtin filters as external
    executable images, and</li>

    <li>copy the editor and external filters to an to an install
    tree [2].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Assuming the editor's startup file initiates syntax coloring
  [3], then at vile run time, the macro file filters/filters.rc
  preferentially selects and executes internal filters when
  coloring a supported language or file format. If a required
  internal filter is not available, filters.rc starts a pipe and
  applies color attributes via the corresponsing external filter
  listed in the table above.</p>

  <h2 id="buildxvile-id"><a name="buildxvile" id=
  "buildxvile">Building xvile</a></h2>

  <p>You must decide which version of xvile you want to build. To a
  certain degree this decision may be forced upon you by which
  libraries you have on your machine. There are three different
  versions you can build.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>X toolkit version: This version uses only the X toolkit to
    implement scrollbars and the window resize grips (meaning
    _vile_ windows, not X windows). As a consequence, it should
    only require the X toolkit library (-lXt) and the Xlib library
    (-lX11). (Don't worry if you don't know what these are or where
    these are; the configuration script will probably be able to
    find them.) The scrollbars in this version look much like those
    found in a standard xterm. We recommend that you try this
    version out first as it is superior in some respects to the
    other versions which use fancy widget sets. To configure this
    version, enter the following command:
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-screen=x11
</pre>

      <p>A minor variation using the Athena widgets supports
      menus:</p>
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-screen=Xaw
</pre>

      <p>Two other variations on the Athena widgets are
      provided:</p>
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-Xaw3d
</pre>

      <p>to link with Xaw 3d library</p>
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-neXtaw
</pre>

      <p>to link with neXT Athena library. There's little
      functional difference between the three versions of Athena
      libraries, they provide different appearance. You can also
      configure with the corresponding scrollbars from the Athena
      library (though we are not as satisfied with their
      performance, particularly with resizing):</p>
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-Xaw-scrollbars
</pre>

      <p>to use Xaw scrollbars rather than our own (applies to all
      variations of Athena library). You can also use Kevin's
      dragging/scrolling logic with the Athena library:</p>
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-drag-extension
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Motif version: This version uses the Motif widget set to
    implement the scrollbars and (vile) window resize pane. To
    configure the Motif version, enter one of the following
    commands (several variations are recognized for each screen
    value to simplify integration with other scripts):
      <pre>
        ./configure --with-screen=motif
        ./configure --with-screen=Xm
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Athena and Motif versions support a menubar, with pulldown
  menus. The configure option <code>--enable-colored-menus</code>
  compiles-in resource values which simplify coloring the menubar
  and menus with the same foreground and background colors. The
  corresponding resource values are <code>menuForeground</code> and
  <code>menuBackground</code>.</p>

  <p>There are also options for configuring the icon used, using
  option values:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>--with-xpm</dt>

    <dd>use this to check for, and use the Xpm library which
    supports colored options (".xpm" in contrast to the monochrome
    ".xbm").</dd>

    <dt>--with-icon-name=XXX</dt>

    <dd>
      allows you to override the icon name. Normally this is the
      "vile" icon, which shows a representation of an editing
      screen. The other choices are

      <ul>
        <li>--with-icon-name=pumpkin</li>

        <li>--with-icon-name=sink</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is a "mini" icon used in a few special cases which
      consists only of the tilde's from the "vile" icon. That is
      unaffected by this configure option.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>--with-pixmapdir=XXX</dt>

    <dd>
      specify the directory in which to install pixmaps, e.g.,
      /usr/share/pixmaps.

      <p>The special value "auto" tells the configure script to
      check for the existence of (fairly standard) locations.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>--with-icondir=XXX</dt>

    <dd>
      specify the directory in which to install icons for desktop,
      e.g., /usr/share/icons.

      <p>The special value "auto" tells the configure script to
      check for the existence of (fairly standard) locations.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>--with-icon-theme=XXX</dt>

    <dd>install icons into desktop theme (default "hicolor"). Vile
    provides ".svg" and ".png" flavors of the icons which are used
    for this option. If you use the icon-theme option, it is still
    a good idea to not suppress the pixmap feature due to
    inconsistencies and gaps in the support provided by the desktop
    configurations.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="installxvile-id"><a name="installxvile" id=
  "installxvile">Installing (x)vile</a></h2>

  <p>Installation of (x)vile is simple. Obtain the appropriate
  privileges (become superuser if necessary), and enter the
  following command:</p>
  <pre>
        make install
</pre>

  <p>If you have ever installed an older version of vile, you
  should probably check to be sure the old help files are gone.
  They used to go to a different place (by default) than they do
  now. It can be most confusing to use an older version of the help
  file with a newer version of the program, and unfortunately,
  older help files didn't have version numbers.</p>

  <p>By default, (x)vile and the script "vile-pager" are installed
  in /usr/local/bin. Other editor components are stored in these
  directories:</p>

  <table border="0" summary="Command Prefixes">
    <colgroup>
      <col width="200px">
    </colgroup>

    <tr>
      <th align="left">component</th>

      <th align="left">install dir</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>vile.hlp</td>

      <td>/usr/local/share/vile</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>vile.1 (man page)</td>

      <td>/usr/local/man/man1</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>syntax coloring filters</td>

      <td>[note 1]</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>coloring keyword files</td>

      <td>/usr/local/share/vile</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>various macro files</td>

      <td>/usr/local/share/vile</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note 1: the value of the environment variable VILE_LIBDIR_PATH
  specifies where configure installs external coloring filters. If
  unset, configure defaults to /usr/local/lib/vile.</p>

  <p>We realize that not everyone has superuser privileges on the
  machines on which they wish to build (x)vile. If you lack
  superuser access or write access to /usr/local, you will want to
  change the installation location. You may do so by using the
  --prefix option to "configure". Suppose you wish to have xvile
  installed in $HOME/bin (your home bin directory). You would issue
  the following commands:</p>
  <pre>
    ./configure --with-screen=x11 --prefix=$HOME
    make install
</pre>

  <p>Here are other useful options for configuring xvile:</p>
  <pre>
  --with-app-defaults=DIR directory in which to install resource files (default: EPREFIX/lib/X11/app-defaults)
  --with-icondir=DIR      directory in which to install icons (default: EPREFIX/share/pixmaps)
  --disable-desktop       disable install of X desktop files
</pre>

  <p>The file INSTALL has more information on installation and on
  configure's --prefix option. If you don't feel like rebuilding
  (likely), you can also edit the makefile and change the "prefix",
  "bindir", or "libdir" definitions--but remember that your changes
  will be lost the next time configure is run.</p>

  <h2 id="sourcedir-id"><a name="sourcedir" id="sourcedir">Building
  in a separate directory</a></h2>

  <p>If you are building (x)vile for several machines or want to
  perhaps simultaneously build and try out the various versions of
  xvile, you will probably want to configure (x)vile to build in a
  directory different from where the source resides. This requires
  that you have make program which correctly uses the VPATH
  variable. GNU make does this well, others may or may not.</p>

  <p>Suppose that the source resides in vile-src. At the same level
  as vile-src, you might perhaps create a directory called
  vile-x11-sunos to indicate that you are building xvile on a
  platform running sunos. You would then cd into this directory and
  issue the following configuration command:</p>
  <pre>
        ../vile-src/configure --with-screen=x11
</pre>

  <p>Another directory at the same level as vile-src might be named
  vile-sunos to indicate that you are building vile on a platform
  running sunos. After you cd into this directory, you'd then issue
  the following command to configure ordinary vile.</p>
  <pre>
        ../vile-src/configure
</pre>

  <p>The "make" step in each case is the same as described above;
  you simply issue the command:</p>
  <pre>
        make
</pre>

  <p>to finish making (x)vile.</p>

  <p>This process is described in more formally in the INSTALL
  document. As described there, you will need to use a version of
  "make" which supports the VPATH variable. And it must support it
  _correctly_. Again, GNU make does this. A lot of older "make"s
  don't.</p>

  <h2 id="versionedprog-id"><a name="versionedprog" id=
  "versionedprog">Building Versioned Executables</a></h2>

  <p>Normally vile is installed without renaming it. But the
  configure script supports these options, which allow you to
  rename the program:</p>
  <pre>
  --program-prefix=PREFIX            prepend PREFIX to installed program names
  --program-suffix=SUFFIX            append SUFFIX to installed program names
  --program-transform-name=PROGRAM   run sed PROGRAM on installed program names
  --with-symlink=XXX      make symbolic link to installed application
</pre>

  <p>In particular, the <code>--with-symlink</code> option is used
  to install executables that are named according to vile's
  version, e.g., <code>vile-9.7za</code>, <code>vile-9.7zb</code>,
  etc., with a symbolic link pointing to the most recently
  installed executables. This allows you to install successive
  releases of vile, and easily switch between them (provided that
  the associated macros are compatible).</p>

  <h2 id="locale-id"><a name="locale" id="locale">Locale
  Support</a></h2>

  <p>There are two parts to locale support:</p>
  <pre>
  --with-locale           use i18n support for character-types
  --with-iconv            use iconv() support for character-types
  --with-libiconv-prefix=DIR
                          search for libiconv in DIR/include and DIR/lib
</pre>

  <p>The <code>--with-locale</code> option provides the basic
  portable support for different character types. It is enabled by
  default since only rather old systems lack support for these
  functions. (Some older systems have the functions but only a
  buggy implementation; it is not simple to make the configure
  script aware of those).</p>

  <p>The <code>--with-iconv</code> option checks for functions that
  vile can use to facilitate editing UTF-8 text on devices which do
  not display UTF-8, as well as work with UTF-8 files which are
  largely compatible with 8-bit encoding.</p>

  <p>Without the iconv option, vile can still work with UTF-8, but
  the support for non-UTF-8 encoding is focused on ISO-8859-1.</p>

  <h2 id="otheroptions-id"><a name="otheroptions" id=
  "otheroptions">Other Compile-Time Options</a></h2>

  <p>Aside from the screen type, most functionality in vile is
  controlled by the "OPT_" #ifdef's in the estruct.h file. Some of
  the more useful ones (or those that require manipulating the
  makefile) are also provided as configure options:</p>
  <pre>
  --with-exec-macros=N    specify count of numbered macros  (anachronism)
  --with-perl             enable use of Perl as an extension language
</pre>

  <h2 id="testingoptions-id"><a name="testingoptions" id=
  "testingoptions">Testing/Development Options</a></h2>

  <p>Several other options appear in the configure script's
  "--help" message. They are used to support testing and
  development, by building various debug versions of vile. These
  include:</p>
  <pre>
  --disable-echo          test: display "compiling" commands (default: on)
  --disable-extensions    test: build only core functions (default: on)
  --disable-rpath-hack    don't add rpath options for additional libraries
  --disable-shell         test: disable shell/external commands (default: on)
  --with-dbmalloc         test: use Conor Cahill's dbmalloc library
  --with-dmalloc          test: use Gray Watson's dmalloc library
  --with-no-leaks         test: free permanent memory, analyze leaks
  --with-trace            test: turn on debug-tracing
  --with-warnings         test: turn on GCC compiler warnings
</pre>

  <p>The dbmalloc and dmalloc libraries are similar, checking for
  memory leaks and related malloc/free problems. Both have
  limitations, so we use both, as well as other tools such as
  Purify and ElectricFence, according to the problem.</p>

  <p>The --with-no-leaks option compiles in code that frees all of
  the permanently allocated memory on exit. This greatly simplifies
  the task of analyzing memory leaks.</p>

  <p>The --with-trace option turns on debug traces that go to the
  Trace.out file. Since vile is a fullscreen program, it is not
  useful to write messages to the screen. (The OPT_HEAPSIZE option
  is an exception; you may be amused by it).</p>

  <p>The --with-warnings option applies mostly to compiles with
  GCC, since it is available across several platforms. We build
  with all available compilers, but their warnings options are not
  consistent.</p>

  <p>Because the echoed commands in the makefile are long, the
  --disable-echo option is provided to shorten the commands, making
  it easy to see the warnings.</p>

  <p>The --disable-extensions and --disable-shell options are for
  testing. Disabling extensions produces a smaller program,
  essentially the core of vile (no macros), which is a workable
  editor. You may wish to build vile without shell support, but
  perhaps not (ymmv).</p>

  <p>The --disable-rpath-hack option is useful for packagers, who
  may not wish the executable to be bound to a particular library
  path from their build environment.</p>
