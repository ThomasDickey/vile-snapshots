FILTERS.DOC
-----------

There are several highlighting filters in the filters subdirectory.  These all
are programs that read a file, usually from the standard input, and write to
the standard output.  Vile invokes these, uses the marked-up text to display
highlighting.

Except for the manpage filter (a special case) all of these can be (and most
are) implemented using lex.


KEYWORDS
--------

Each filter reads one or more keyword files, which list specific keywords
and their highlighting attributes, as well as classes of keywords.

The filters search for these files in the current, $HOME, $HOME/vile and
startup directories.  On Unix, the keyword files in the current and $HOME
directories are hidden using a "." prefix.  Except for MS-DOS, the suffix is
".keywords"; on that platform it is ".key".  In the source distribution, these
files are ".key", to keep them compatible with MS-DOS 8.3 filename lengths.

You can specify the root name to search, otherwise they search for "vile" and
the compiled-in filter name.  For example, on a Unix host, the C filter
(vile-c-filt) searches first here:

	./.vile.keywords
	$HOME/.vile.keywords
	$HOME/.vile/vile.keywords
	$VILE_STARTUP_PATH/vile.keywords

	[ If $VILE_STARTUP_PATH is not defined, the filter checks the
	"prefix" directory specified when all filters were compiled
	(default path is /usr/local/share/vile/vile.keywords). ]

and then here:

	./.c.keywords
	$HOME/.c.keywords
	$HOME/.vile/c.keywords
	$VILE_STARTUP_PATH/c.keywords

	[ Again, if $VILE_STARTUP_PATH is not defined, the filter checks
	the "prefix" directory specified when all filters were compiled
	(default path is /usr/local/share/vile/c.keyords). ]

In each case, vile-c-filt stops as soon as it finds the desired file.  On a
non-Unix host, the search looks like this:

	./vile.keywords
	$HOME/vile.keywords
	$HOME/vile/vile.keywords
	$VILE_STARTUP_PATH/vile.keywords

	./c.keywords
	$HOME/c.keywords
	$HOME/vile/c.keywords
	$VILE_STARTUP_PATH/c.keywords


The vile.keywords file contains color information for the most common classes. 
The c.keywords file contains the actual keywords to be highlighted, referenced
to the classes which are in turn colored.  You can see the search for keyword
files by running the filter with a -v option, repeating the option (-vv) to
obtain more verbose traces.  Note that filters may be compiled-into vile.  In
that case (vile calls the filter using the attribute-directly command), you can
still get a trace by adding the -v option to the filtername line of the
majormode.  The trace will go to the message line, but also if you have
	set popup-msgs
specified, to the [Messages] buffer.

Predefined keyword classes include (but may not necessarily be used in specific
filters):

	Action
	Comment
	Ident
	Ident2
	Keyword
	Keyword2
	Literal
	Number
	Preproc
	Type

A few filters, e.g., cweb, latex, diff, use additional classes.  The predefined
classes are a guideline, to implement a common style across the different
filters.

Each line in the keyword file consists of two strings separated by a colon (:).
If the first string is empty, the line is treated as a comment.  The second
string is interpreted as follows:

	+ if quoted with single quotes, any value is permitted.  Use a doubled
	  quote to insert a quote character.  Literal values of this type are
	  used to override internal parameters of the filter programs.  See
	  m4-filt.c for an example.

	+ otherwise (the usual case), the string is an identifier, which
	  happens to include the characters used in vile's control/A
	  highlighting attributes (digits plus the characters ABCDEFIRU).

	  If the second string matches a keyword class (or in fact, any other
	  keyword), the highlighting attributes of that keyword are used.  An
	  empty attribute string implies the default class, which usually
	  is "Keyword".

	  If the second string does not match a keyword, it must be a set of
	  highlighting attributes, which will be used for the first string.
	  A special case is made for a string beginning "N", which is treated
	  as no-attributes.

	  See "Writing your own filters" in vile.hlp for additional details
	  about attribute strings.

The keyword file reader supports a limited include facility.  If a line begins
with ".include", it reads from the given keyword file.  A few filters (such as
html) require multiple symbol tables; these include using ".merge".  In either
case, the parameter of the include is the root name of the keyword file, e.g.,
"c" for "c.key".  Use the ".table" directive to simply switch to a different
symbol table in the same file with the same effect as ".merge".

Specify abbreviations using a '*' character, e.g.,
	vi*le
to match any of vi, vil, vile.  You can change the '*' character using the
".abbrev" directive.  A special case is provided for languages such as SQL*PLUS,
using the '?' character, e.g.,
	rem?ark
Use ".brief" to alter the special character '?'.

Use the ".default" directive to change the default class.  The parameter must
be the name of a class which has already been defined.  Omit the parameter to
reset the default back to "Keyword".

You can change the characters assigned to ':' and '.' using ".equals" and
".meta" directives, respectively.

Some of the filters match case-independent keywords (e.g., the DOS batchfiles). 
The keywords file must give these names in lowercase, since the filtered text
is converted to lowercase when matching.

You can modify the behavior slightly, by giving an absolute pathname with the
-k option, but otherwise the filters search for both "vile" and the specific
language keywords, if any.


OPTIONS
-------

A few options are common to all filters:

  -d	is recognized when the filters have been compiled with "DEBUG" defined.
	This is used in the more complicated filters such as perl and ruby to
	show the parsing.

  -k FILE

  -q	exits the filter before writing the marked-up output.  This happens
	after processing the class definitions, so it is useful in combination
	with the -v option to simply obtain the class information.

  -t	holds the tabstop setting, which can be used in a filter for column
	computations.

  -v	verbose, turns on extra output which can be used for troubleshooting
	configuration problems.

The C syntax filter recognizes additional options to customize it for Java and
JavaScript:

  -j	Extend name- and literal-syntax to include Java.

  -p	Disallow preprocessor lines.

  -s	for JavaScript (to support jsmode).  This controls whether to allow
	regular expressions in certain cases.

use the same syntax as other majormodes:

	cppmode		C++ uses C filter
	cshmode		C-shell uses shell filter
	imakemode	Imake uses C filter
	javamode	Java uses C filter
	jsmode		JavaScript uses C filter
	nmakemode	nmake uses C filter
	pcmode		printcap uses termcap filter
	texmode		TeX uses latex filter
	vbmode		Visual Basic uses basic filter


NOTE
----

The lex filters have been well tested only with flex, which treats newlines
differently.  Older versions of lex may not support the %x states.
