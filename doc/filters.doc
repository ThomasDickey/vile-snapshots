Syntax highlighting filters for vile                               version 9.8
------------------------------------                               -----------

                          Syntax Highlighting Filters

   There are several highlighting filters in the filters subdirectory. These
   all are programs that read a file, usually from the standard input, and
   write to the standard output. Vile invokes these, uses the marked-up text
   to display highlighting.

   Except for the manpage filter (a special case) all of these can be (and
   most are) implemented using lex.


Keywords
--------
   Each filter reads one or more keyword files, which list specific keywords
   and their highlighting attributes, as well as classes of keywords.

   The filters search for these files in the current, $HOME, $HOME/vile and
   startup directories. On Unix, the keyword files in the current and $HOME
   directories are hidden using a "." prefix. Except for MS-DOS, the suffix
   is ".keywords"; on that platform it is ".key". In the source distribution,
   these files are ".key", to keep them compatible with MS-DOS 8.3 filename
   lengths.

   You can specify the root name to search, otherwise they search for "vile"
   and the compiled-in filter name. The locations checked are:

     * the current directory
     * the home-directory (as well as a vile-specific subdirectory of that)
     * one or more locations known as the "startup path". There is a
       compiled-in default startup path list which can be overridden by the
       VILE_STARTUP_PATH environment variable.
   For example (referring to the last as $VILE_STARTUP_PATH), on a Unix host,
   the C filter (vile-c-filt) searches first here:

     ./.vile.keywords
     $HOME/.vile.keywords
     $HOME/.vile/vile.keywords
     $VILE_STARTUP_PATH/vile.keywords

   and then here:

     ./.c.keywords
     $HOME/.c.keywords
     $HOME/.vile/c.keywords
     $VILE_STARTUP_PATH/c.keywords

   In each case, vile-c-filt stops as soon as it finds the desired file. On a
   non-Unix host, the search looks like this:

     ./vile.keywords
     $HOME/vile.keywords
     $HOME/vile/vile.keywords
     $VILE_STARTUP_PATH/vile.keywords

     ./c.keywords
     $HOME/c.keywords
     $HOME/vile/c.keywords
     $VILE_STARTUP_PATH/c.keywords

   The vile.keywords file contains color information for the most common
   classes. The c.keywords file contains the actual keywords to be
   highlighted, referenced to the classes which are in turn colored. You can
   see the search for keyword files by running the filter with a -v option,
   repeating the option (-vv) to obtain more verbose traces. Note that
   filters may be compiled-into vile. In that case (vile calls the filter
   using the attribute-directly command), you can still get a trace by adding
   the -v option to the filtername line of the majormode. The trace will go
   to the message line, but also if you have

     set popup-msgs

   specified, to the [Messages] buffer.

   Predefined keyword classes include (but may not necessarily be used in
   specific filters):

         Action
         Comment
         Ident
         Ident2
         Keyword
         Keyword2
         Literal
         Number
         Preproc
         Type

   A few filters, e.g., cweb, latex, diff, use additional classes. The
   predefined classes are a guideline, to implement a common style across the
   different filters.

   Each line in the keyword file consists of two strings separated by a colon
   (:). If the first string is empty, the line is treated as a comment. The
   second string is interpreted as follows:

     * if quoted with single quotes, any value is permitted. Use a doubled
       quote to insert a quote character. Literal values of this type are
       used to override internal parameters of the filter programs. See
       m4-filt.c for an example.
     * otherwise (the usual case), the string is an identifier, which happens
       to include the characters used in vile's control/A highlighting
       attributes (digits plus the characters ABCDEFIRU).

       If the second string matches a keyword class (or in fact, any other
       keyword), the highlighting attributes of that keyword are used. An
       empty attribute string implies the default class, which usually is
       "Keyword".

       If the second string does not match a keyword, it must be a set of
       highlighting attributes, which will be used for the first string. A
       special case is made for a string beginning "N", which is treated as
       no-attributes.

       See "Writing your own filters" in vile.hlp for additional details
       about attribute strings.

   The keyword file reader supports a limited include facility. In each case,
   the parameter of the include is the root name of the keyword file, e.g.,
   "c" for "c.key".

     * If a line begins with ".include", it reads from the given keyword
       file.
     * A few filters (such as yacc) require multiple symbol tables; these
       include using ".source".
     * Use the ".table" directive to simply switch to a different symbol
       table in the same file with the same effect as ".source".
     * Use the ".merge" directive to read into the current symbol table from
       another file.

   Specify abbreviations using a '*' character, e.g.,

         vi*le

   to match any of vi, vil, vile. You can change the '*' character using the
   ".abbrev" directive. A special case is provided for languages such as
   SQL*PLUS, using the '?' character, e.g.,

         rem?ark

   Use ".brief" to alter the special character '?'.

   For either ".abbrev" or ".brief", omitting the parameter disables the
   feature.

   Use the ".default" directive to change the default class. The parameter
   must be the name of a class which has already been defined. Omit the
   parameter to reset the default back to "Keyword".

   You can change the characters assigned to ':' and '.' using ".equals" and
   ".meta" directives, respectively.

   Some of the filters match case-independent keywords (e.g., the DOS
   batchfiles). The keywords file must give these names in lowercase, since
   the filtered text is converted to lowercase when matching.

   You can modify the behavior slightly, by giving an absolute pathname with
   the -k option, but otherwise the filters search for both "vile" and the
   specific language keywords, if any.


OPTIONS
-------
   A few options are common to all filters:

   -d
           is recognized when the filters have been compiled with "DEBUG"
           defined. This is used in the more complicated filters such as
           perl, ruby and sql to show the parsing.

   -i
           is used (in all except for html and imake) to tell vile to ignore
           case when matching keywords. It is ignored in the few instances
           mentioned because those filters contain logic to distinguish
           between caseless and case-sensitive syntax.

   -k FILE
           specifies the keyword file to use.

   -q
           exits the filter before writing the marked-up output. This happens
           after processing the class definitions, so it is useful in
           combination with the -v option to simply obtain the class
           information.

   -Q
           is like "-q", but also writes to stderr (or [Filter Messages]) the
           resulting keyword information.

   -t
           holds the tabstop setting, which can be used in a filter for
           column computations.

   -v
           verbose, turns on extra output which can be used for
           troubleshooting configuration problems.

   The C syntax filter recognizes additional options to customize it for
   Java, JavaScript and Objective-C:

   -j
           Extend name- and literal-syntax to include Java.

   -o
           Allow '@' in names, for directives.

   -p
           Disallow preprocessor lines.

   -s
           for JavaScript (to support jsmode). This controls whether to allow
           regular expressions in certain cases.

   -#
           support C# verbatim string literals

   The HTML filter recognizes a "-a" option to customize it for "asp" files,
   as well as a "-j" option to customize for JavaScript script-tags.

   The keyword filter recognizes a "-c" option to tell it to highlight color
   codes with the corresponding color rather than the "Action" color.

   The MAN filter recognizes a "-8" option which tells it to use 8-bit
   approximations for some common UTF-8 equivalents such as hyphen.

   The Ruby filter recognizes a "-e" option to customize it for "ERB" files.

   The SH filter recognizes a "-K" option to turn on Korn shell's syntax for
   dotted variable names. The ksh93 "vnames" allow a dotted name such as
   "$foo.bar" to be defined it is root ("$foo") is already defined. That
   affects portability of scripts because other sh-like programs do not
   behave this way. The "-K" option also handles ksh's so-called "ANSI C
   quoting" which uses single-quotes after a dollar sign as if those were
   actually double-quotes.

   The XML filter recognizes "-A" and "-M" options to recognize Ant and Maven
   macrodef and property tags, respectively.

   use the same syntax as other majormodes:

   cppmode     C++ uses C filter
   cshmode     C-shell uses shell filter
   csmode      C# uses C filter
   csvmode     CSV uses text filter
   delphimode  Delphi uses Pascal filter
   desktopmode Desktop uses INI filter
   docbookmode Docbook uses XML filter
   imakemode   Imake uses C filter
   javamode    Java uses C filter
   jsmode      JavaScript uses C filter
   jspmode     JSP uses HTML filter
   nmakemode   nmake uses make filter
   nsismode    nsis uses def filter
   pcmode      printcap uses termcap filter
   texmode     TeX uses latex filter
   vbmode      Visual Basic uses basic filter
   vbsmode     Visual Basic Scripting uses basic filter
   xpmmode     XPM uses C filter


NOTE
----
   The lex filters have been well tested only with flex, which treats
   newlines differently. Older versions of lex may not support the %x states.
