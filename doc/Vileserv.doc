                     Vile Server and Session Perl Extension

   This Perl extension to vile gives you the ability to send edit requests to
   a running Vile (sort of like gnuserv does for Emacs). Vile is lightweight
   enough to run several at a time, but when using a file manager (like
   TkDesk) it is convenient to click on files and "add" them to a current
   Vile session.

   Attached are two files, Vileserv.pm and vileget. Vileserv.pm is for
   loading into a perl-enabled Vile session, and vileget is a utility for
   sending requests to the editor. You can use pod2man to get the man pages:

         pod2man Vileserv.pm > vileserv.man
         pod2man vileget > vileget.man
