Copyright:

    Previous versions of vile were limited to non-commercial use due
    to their inclusion of code from versions of MicroEMACS which were
    restricted in that way.  in the current version of vile, every
    attempt has been made to ensure that this later code has been
    removed or rewritten, returning vile's original basis to public
    domain status.  the current version of vile, however, is _not_ in
    the public domain -- it is released under the provisions of the
    GNU General Public License.

    On Debian GNU/Linux systems, the complete text of the GNU General
    Public License can be found in `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.
