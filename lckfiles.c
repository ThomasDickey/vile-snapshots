/*
 * lckfiles.c   set_lock() and release_lock(), for maintaining
 *		little file.lck style lockfiles.  this isn't what
 *		we would call a standard mechanism.  but it's simple.
 *
 *		it's also not completely integrated with the editor --
 *		for instance, one can probably bypass the locking mechanism
 *		in various ways.  it is intended as an _aid_ to multiple
 *		edits.  _not_ a cure-all.  it works well for the people
 *		at Baan who contributed the code.  i make no other claims
 *		for it.
 *
 *		operation:  if the global "usefilelock" is on, then when
 *		"file" is edited, a "file.lck" is created, containing the
 *		username of the user doing the editing.  when a file is
 *		edited for which there already exists a .lck file, the buffer
 *		mode "locked" is set to true and "locker" is set to the name
 *		of the user that created the .lck.  this information will
 *		appear on the status line, as "locked by pgf", and the
 *		buffer will be marked readonly.  the .lck file will be
 *		deleted at most of the appropriate times.
