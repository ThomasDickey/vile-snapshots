Programmed Macros in vile
==========================

	[ The following documentation is copied almost verbatim from
	chapter 13 of "MicroEMACS Full Screen Text Editor Reference Manual,
	Version 3.10 March 19, 1989" The copyright for that document is
	"(C)opyright 1988, 1989 by Brian Straight and Daniel M. Lawrence". 
	I have done a global substitute of "vile" for "MicroEMACS", and
	adjusted the document in various other small ways to make it match
	vile's current functionality.  (Paul Fox, 4/94) ]

	[ Some more examples of vile macros can be found in the file
	vile.hlp.  ]

	Macros are programs that are used to customize the editor and to
	perform complicated editing tasks.  They may be stored in files or
	buffers and may be executed using an appropriate command, or bound
	to a particular keystroke.  The execute-macro-<n> commands cause
	the macro, numbered from 1 to 40, to be executed.  The execute-file
	command allows you to execute a macro stored in a disk file, and
	the execute-buffer command allows you to execute a macro stored in
	a buffer.  Macros are stored for easy execution by executing files
	that contain the store-macro command.

	If you need more than 40 macros, named macros, called procedures,
	can be used.  The store-procedure command takes a string argument
	which is the name of a procedure to store.  These procedures then
	can be executed with the run command.  Also, giving the name of a
	stored procedure within another macro will execute that named
	procedure as if it had been called up with the run command.

	There are many different aspects to this macro language.  Editor
	commands are the various commands that manipulate text, buffers,
	windows, et cetera, within the editor.  Directives are commands
	which control what lines get executed within a macro.  Also there
	are various types of variables.  Environmental variables both
	control and report on different aspects of the editor.  User
	variables hold string values which may be changed and inspected. 
	Buffer variables allow text to be placed into variables. 
	Interactive variable allow the program to prompt the user for
	information.  Functions can be used to manipulate all these
	variables.



Comments
--------
	Any line beginning with a semi-colon (;) or double-quote (")
	character is ignored.  The semi-colon is inherited from MicroEMACS,
	the double-quote is for vi compatibility.

Constants
---------
	All constants and variable contents are stored as strings of
	characters.  Numbers are stored digit by digit as characters.  This
	allows the variables to be "typeless", not having different
	variables types be legal in different contexts.  This has the
	disadvantage of forcing the user to be more careful about the
	context of the statements variables are placed in, but in turn
	gives them more flexibility in where they can place variables. 
	Needless to say, this also allows the expression evaluator to be
	both concise and quick.

	Wherever statements need to have arguments, it is legal to place
	constants.  A constant is a double quote character, followed by a
	string of characters, and terminated by another double quote
	character.  To represent various special characters within a
	constant, the backslash (\) character is used.  The character
	following the backslash is interpreted according to the following
	table:

	Sequence        Result
	\n              ^J      newline character
	\r              ^M      carriage return
	\\              \       backslash
	\b              ^H      backspace
	\f              ^L      formfeed
	\t              ^I      tab
	\a              ^G      bell
	\s                      space
	\"              "       quote
	\xNN		0xNN	the character in hex
	\NNN		NNN	the character in octal

	Any character not in the table which follows a backslash will be
	passed unmodified.  This action is similar to the ^V
	quote-character command available from the keyboard.

	The double quotes around constants are not needed if the constant
	contains no internal white space and it also does not happen to
	meet the rules for any other commands, directives, variables, or
	functions.  This is reasonably useful for numeric constants.


Variables
---------
	Variables can be used to return values within expressions, as
	repeat counts to editing commands, or as text to be inserted into
	buffers and messages.  The value of these variables is set using
	the set-variable command.  The shorter form, "setv", may also
	always be used.  For example, to set the current column position to
	64, the following macro line would be used:

		set-variable curcol 64

	or to have the contents of %name inserted at the point in the
	current buffer, the command to use would be:

		insert-string %name



Environmental Variables
-----------------------
	These variables are used to change different aspects of the way the
	editor works.  Also they will return the current settings if used
	as part of an expression.  All environmental variable names begin
	with a dollar sign ($) and are in lower case.

User variables
--------------
	User variables allow you, the user, to store strings and manipulate
	them.  These strings can be pieces of text, numbers (in text form),
	or the logical values TRUE and FALSE.  These variables can be
	combined, tested, inserted into buffers, and otherwise used to
	control the way your macros execute.  All users variable names must
	begin with a percent sign (%) and may contain any printing
	characters.


Interactive variables
---------------------
	Interactive variables are actually a method to prompt the user for
	a string.  This is done by using an at sign (@) followed either
	with a quoted string, or a variable containing a string.  The
	string is then placed on the bottom line, and the editor waits for
	the user to type in a string.  Then the string typed in by the
	user is returned as the value of the interactive variable.  For
	example:

		set-variable %quest "What file? "
		find-file @%quest

	will ask the user for a file name, and then attempt to find it. 
	Note also that complex expressions can be built up with these
	operators, such as:

	@&cat &cat "File to decode[" %default "]: "

		which prompts the user with the concatenated string.


Functions
---------
	Functions can be used to manipulate variables in various ways. 
	Functions can have one, two, or three arguments.  These arguments
	will always be placed after the function on the current command
	line.  For example, if we wanted to increase the current fill
	column by two, using the set-variable command, we would write:

		setv $fillcol &add $fillcol 2
		 \      \      \      \     \____second operand
		  \      \      \      \_________first operand
		   \      \      \_______________function to execute
		    \      \_____________________variable to set
		     \___________________________set-variable command

	Function names always begin with the ampersand (&) character, and
	are only significant to the first three characters after the
	ampersand.  Functions will normally expect one of three types of
	arguments, and will automatically convert types when needed.

	<num>         an ascii string of digits which is interpreted
		      as a numeric value.  Any string which does not
		      start with a digit or a minus sign (-) will be
		      considered zero.


	<str>         An  arbitrary  string  of  characters.  At the
		      moment, strings are limited to  128 characters
		      in length.

	<log>         A  logical  value  consisting  of  the  string
		      "TRUE" or "FALSE".   Numeric strings will also
		      evaluate to "FALSE" if they are equal to zero,
		      and "TRUE" if they  are  non-zero.   Arbitrary
		      text strings will have the value of "FALSE".

	A list of the currently available functions follows: Functions are
	always used in lower case, the uppercase letters in the function
	table are the short form of the function (i.e.  &div for &divide).

					this returns the environment string
	associated
					with <str>
	&BIND           <str>           return the function name bound to the
					keystroke <str>

	Logical Testing functions:      (returns <log>)

	&NOT            <log>           Return the opposite logical value
	&AND            <log1> <log2>   Returns TRUE if BOTH logical arguments

	&WR          	<str>           Is the named file <str> writable?

	Special Functions:

	&GLObal		<modename>	retrieves global mode setting
	&LOCal		<modename>	retrieves local mode setting

	&INDirect       <str>           Evaluate <str> as a variable.

	This last function deserves more explanation.  The &IND function
	evaluates its argument, takes the resulting string, and then uses
	it as a variable name.  For example, given the following code
	sequence:

		; set up reference table

		setv %one        "elephant"
		setv %two        "giraffe"
		setv %three      "donkey"

		setv %index "two"
		insert-string &ind %index

	the string "giraffe" would have been inserted at the point in the
	current buffer.  This indirection can be safely nested up to about
	10 levels.


Directives
----------
	Directives are commands which only operate within an executing
	macro, i.e.  they do not make sense as a single command.  As such,
	they cannot be called up singly or bound to keystroke.  Used within
	macros, they control what lines are executed and in what order.

	Directives always start with the tilde (~) character and must be
	the first thing placed on a line.  Directives executed
	interactively (via the execute-command- line command) will be
	ignored.


    ~ENDM Directive
    ---------------
	This directive is used to terminate a macro being stored.  For
	example, if a file is being executed contains the text:

		;       Read in a file in view mode, and make the window red
		;	(color is only settable on some platforms, e.g. DOS)

		26      store-macro
			find-file @"File to view: "
			set-mode "view"
			set-mode bcolor "red"
		~endm

		write-message "[Consult macro has been loaded]"

	only the lines between the store-macro command and the ~ENDM
	directive are stored in macro 26.  Both numbered macros and named
	procedures (via the store-procedure command) should be terminated
	with this directive.


    ~FORCE Directive
    ----------------
	When a macro is executed, if any command fails, the macro is
	terminated at that point.  If a line is preceded by a ~FORCE
	directive, execution continues whether the command succeeds or not. 
	For example:

		set-variable %quest "What file? "
		find-file @%quest
		~force set-mode bcolor "red"
		goto-beginning-of-file	
		insert-string "this is a new first line in that file\n"

	will function correctly even if this version of the editor does not
	support color.  (Currently, only the DOS version supports color.)


    ~IF, ~ELSE, and ~ENDIF Directives
    ---------------------------------
	This directive allows statements to be executed only if a condition
	specified in the directive is met.  Every line following the ~IF
	directive, until the first ~ELSE or ~ENDIF directive, is only
	executed if the expression following the ~IF directive evaluates to
	a TRUE value.  For example, the following macro segment creates the
	portion of a text file automatically.

	    ~if &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"
		    insert-string "First, rematerialize\n"
	    ~endif
	    ~if &sequal %planet "earth"     ;If we have landed on earth...
		~if &sequal %time "late 20th century"  ;and we are then
			write-message "Contact U.N.I.T."
		~else
			insert-string "Investigate the situation....\n"
			insert-string "(SAY 'stay here Sara')\n"
		~endif
	    ~else
		setv %conditions @"Atmosphere conditions outside? "
		~if &sequal %conditions "safe"
			insert-string &cat "Go outside......" "\n"
			insert-string "lock the door\n"
		~else
			insert-string "Dematerialize..try somewhen else"
			newline
		~endif
	    ~endif


    ~GOTO Directive
    ---------------
	Flow can be controlled within a macro using the ~GOTO directive. 
	It takes as an argument a label.  A label consists of a line
	starting with an asterisk (*) and then an alphanumeric label.  Only
	labels in the currently executing macro can be jumped to, and
	trying to jump to a non-existing label terminates execution of a
	macro.  For example..

		;Create a block of DATA statements for a BASIC program

			insert-string "1000 DATA "
			setv %linenum 1000

		*nxtin
			update-screen           ;make sure we see the changes
			setv %data @"Next number: "
			~if &equal %data 0
				~goto finish
			~endif

			~if &greater $curcol 60
				2 delete-previous-character
				newline
				setv %linenum &add %linenum 10
				insert-string &cat %linenum " DATA "
			~endif

			insert-string &cat %data ", "
			~goto nxtin

		*finish

			2 delete-previous-character
			newline


    ~WHILE and ~ENDWHILE Directives
    -------------------------------
	This directive allows you to set up repetitive tasks easily and
	efficiently.  If a group of statements need to be executed while a
	certain condition is true, enclose them with a while loop.  For
	example,

		~while &less $curcol 70
			insert-string &cat &cat "[" <stuff "]"
		~endwhile

	places items from buffer "stuff" in the current line until the
	cursor is at or past column 70.  While loops may be nested and can
	contain and be the targets of ~GOTOs with no ill effects.  Using a
	while loop to enclose a repeated task will run much faster than the
	corresponding construct using ~IFs.


    ~BREAK Directive
    ----------------
	This directive allows the user to abort out of the currently most
	inner while loop, regardless of the condition.  It is often used to
	abort processing for error conditions.  For example:

	;       Read in files and substitute "begining" with "beginning"

		setv %filename <list
		~while &not &seq %filename "<end>"
			~force  find-file %filename
			~if &seq $status FALSE
				write-message "[File read error]"
				~break
			~endif
			beginning-of-file
			replace-string "begining" "beginning"
			save-file
			setv %filename <list
		~endwhile

	This while loop will process files until the list is exhausted or
	there is an error while reading a file.


    ~RETURN Directive
    -----------------
	The ~RETURN Directive causes the current macro to exit, either
	returning to the caller (if any) or to interactive mode.  For
	example:

	;       Check the monitor type and setv %mtyp

		~if &sres "CGA"
			setv %mtyp 1
		~else
			setv %mtyp 2
			~return
		~endif

		insert-string "You are on an old machine!\n"
