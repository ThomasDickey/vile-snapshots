vile bug/enhancement/wish list (mostly wishes ;-)
------------------------
$Header: /users/source/archives/vile.vcs/RCS/buglist,v 1.325 1997/03/30 22:04:44 tom Exp $
----------------------
	(E means enhancement, L,M,H are low, medium, high priority)

E	add ":n file"
	    (:n means go to the next file in a series of files.
	    :n file means go to that specific file - one can specify a
	    +<cmd> before file to indicate the vi command which should be
	    executed when entering the command.)

E	now that paragraphs, sections, and sentences are all selectable
	with regexps, they (and the tabstop value) are prime candidates for
	moving into a "mode-values" set of values.  A buffer would inherit
	either the global normal-mode values, or the global c-mode values.

E	:k, to set a mark, won't work as ":ka" or ":kb".  Must use ":k a"

E	patterns as addresses do not work, e.g. ":/str1/,/str2/d".  They're
	hard to parse the way things are set up right now.  We could accumulate
	the whole commandline, and then parse it, the way real vi does, but we'd
	lose the "prompt and display last response" behavior.

E	should add an option to support file locking, rather than the current
	ifdef stuff.  (this is only useful if we match the GNU locking
	protocol.) And it's not clear that in an NFS'ed environment that
	it's all that easy to get that style of locking right anyway.

E	the scrsearch functions could become region based -- as in "search for
	the next occurrence of the region", which would usually be a word.  And
	the ^A/ version could become "a/ (search for the contents of buffer a),
	if you know what I mean.

E	g should become a region command.  Then it could take ranges, as
	it should, and could also become an operator command.

E	collapse command execution code to as few places as possible.
	Its currently spread through execute(), operator(),
	docmd(), and usekreg().

E	mlreply line should ideally be a one line buffer, so inline editing
	can be done on it.

E	I haven't even come close to testing vile for
	memory-full conditions.  Some malloc() packages give 95%
	warnings -- perhaps something like that should be done for
	safety.

E	marks should perhaps be linked onto lines.  this would make a lot
        of things a lot easier, since a mark would travel with the
        line, instead of having to be moved when the line is
        reallocated etc.  the U line could be treated as a special
        mark.  The "copied" flag needed by undo could be a special
        sort of mark as well.  Implementation of the "tag stack"
	would be aided by this as well.

L	vile really ought to use unix-crypt if it is available.

E	can't search for a NUL in a buffer.

E	":e" and ":e!" should share the same prompt data, which should be
	editable / history.  They both should default (like vi!) to the
	current buffer.

E	for consistency, 'execute-macro-nn' should be 'execute-macro nn';
	doing this would allow modification to eliminate a fixed number of
	macro-buffers.

E	should ifdef the 'autobuffer' code for users who do not need vi-style
	buffering.

--------------

    The ed 'transfer' and 'move' commands don't work.
    (to copy and move text around.  e.g., :'a,'bt$.)

--------------------------------

Though I use it, I'm still not quite satisfied with the qident stuff.  It
needs to be more flexible.  That is, I'd like to make it user defined.
For example
	find-tag $qidentifier
should be expressable as a character class like
	find-tag &anyof "a-zA-Z_0-9:"
in a macro.  Or even more generally, as a regular expression:
	find-tag &scan "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9:]\\*"
A leading ^ would root the search at the current cursor position.
Absence of a leading ^ would start at the current cursor position but would
scan ahead until it found a match.  That way I can redefine ^] to pick
up the next word even if the cursor is before the start of the word (thus
better mimicking vi's behavior).

[ This can almost be done with the $match variable, e.g.
	7 store-macro
		search-forward "[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9:]*"
		find-tag $match
	~endm

	bind-key execute-macro-7 ^A-g
 - pgf ]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, I encountered the following problem: I am editing foo.tex and
call latex using ^X!latex foo.tex. There is an error, so latex waits for
input -> vile sits waiting and nothing helps. I think this should
be interruptable. I will agree with you that the ^X! command was not
intended for this, but still...

But ok, the real problem is that after I kill latex and
vile comes back to life I can no longer filter parts of text using
!fmt. The text just gets deleted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I just grabbed a copy of xvi.  I noted some interesting tidbits while
reading the "differences between vi and xvi" document.  Some of these would
be nice in vile.


     As well as the normal named (conjugate) buffers, and the  default
     one  named @, several extra buffers named :, /, ?  and ! contain
     the last command lines entered for each of the command types.  So
     for  instance,  @: will re-execute the last colon command, or you
     can insert it into your buffer, edit it and  then re-execute  it
     (e.g. with dd@@).


     +    In insert and replace modes, ^A has the same meaning  as  ^@
          in  vi,  except  that it works at any time, not just for the
          first character.  Also, typing ^Bx, where x is the name of a
          conjugate  buffer,  inserts the contents of that buffer into
          the input stream at that point.  The buffer named  <  always
          contains the last thing inserted, so that ^B< is the same as
          ^A.


------------------------
I wish ^X-!  could execute shell commands async'ly, i.e.  I should not have
to wait/do nothing while waiting for the ouput of compiling.  I should be
able to edit stuff in other buffers or even ^X-^X to edit src codes
while compilation is still going on.

------------
similar to above -- sub-commands run from ^X-! or ":[erw] !cmd" should be
"interactive" to the extent that user's input should be sent to the cmd
at least on a line-by-line basis (i.e. we can't send raw keystrokes -- we
have to do canonical processing.  of course, we should really use pty's, and
reconnect input and capture output.)  some commands like latex prompt for
more input when partway done.

========(VMS-VILE)=============================================================
Unfinished items on vax/vms (dickey@clark.net):

	+ if the current directory has changed, offer to restore it on exit.
	  (Note that if the _device_ portion has changed, the original
	  directory should be restored anyway!).

	+ add key bindings and other support to make the vt100 keypad work for
	  me (e.g., like EDT).

	+ see if I can decode ".dia" files, if so connect it to finderr.c

	+ catch exception/signals, and restore terminal settings.

	+ make write-pipes work (actually, flesh out to use 'npopen' coding
	  scheme, like the MSDOS stuff).

	+ I had a case in which I wanted to read the contents of one file into
	  another; they had the same buffer name; the target buffer got the
	  filename for the source, e.g.,

	  	:e []foo		- read and determined version # ok
		:r [-.temp]foo		- current filename reset to [-.temp]foo
------------------------------------------------------------


it would be nice if vile would fold text...

	This feature appeared in uEmacs version 3.10.23 and you can
use archie/xarchie to file fue.tar.Z (fue - folding-micro-emacs).

[ someone said they were going to fold this in, so to speak.  i'm not
real comfortable with the idea, since the uemacs code causes the LINE
struct to grow _enormously_ ]


-----------

	When I execute a keyboard macro using ^X-& I cannot repeat this
	using the dot command. Instead, the last command in the macro
	is repeated.
    [ this is because '.' doesn't do @ macros either...]

------------------------------


Can you add the '>' character to the list of comment chars for paragraph
reformatting?  I would live to be able to reformat mail quotes (like shown
above).

[ pgf notes: I did this, as chris suggested, but formatregion should use
  the comments regexp to match a comment delimiter at the beginning of
  line, and should insert the comment delimiter of the _second_ line (so
  that boxed C comments work right)in subsequent reformatted lines,
  including leading but not trailing whitespace.  indentlen should be
  counted _after_ the width of such a comment delimiter.  this would make
  paragraphs that are indented way after the delimiter keep their indent.
  commented paragraphs should end when exp->mlen for the comment regexp is
  equal to llength(DOT), i.e.  it's the whole line.  (we'll need to take
  the $ off the end of the comment regexp).  ]

------------------------------
Another enhacement.
How about a history file.  say I have been using vile and
quit and come back in later I can use the history file.

--------------------------

In a xterm window the down arrow (which sends ESC-O-B) works for individual
presses.  If you hold down the key then letter Bs get peppered through out
the file.  It appears that the ESC is occasionally being missed so that the
following OB puts a B in the file.

In my case I'm on a workstation running 4.1.3 and xterm using rlogin to
connect to a 690 server (lightly loaded) running 4.1.3 and running vile
on the 690.

I just ran vile locally and didn't see the problem.
-------------------------------


I found a bug (new with 3.59) on our Pyramid SVR4 (but not Pyramid SVR3,
SunOS 4.1.1, AIX 3.2) where
	xvile tmp &
pops up the xvile window briefly, the window dies, the xterm I started
xvile from says
	[1]  + suspended (tty input)  xvile3.59 tmp
and then after a couple seconds the xterm itself vanishes!  However,
	xvile tmp
works fine, except that the process is in the foreground.
 > The bug on the Pyramid SVR4 machine with xvile & suspending itself,
 > committing suicide, and then blowing away the xterm still exists.
 > For the time being I just remember to run xvile on a different
 > machine.

-----------------------------
apply Alistair's min/max regexp patch

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With vim 1.27 you can configure its behaviour regarding backspace using
the 'backspace' variable. From the help file:

backspace (bs)	    number    0     0 standard Vi, 1 delete NL, 2 delete all
i.e. if bs is non-zero, you can backup to the previous line, and if it's
a 2, you can backup past the insertion point.

i don't think this is optimal -- i think you should be able to choose
independently whether you backup past the newline or past the insertion point.

in any case, vile won't let you back up past the newline during an insert.
when _not_ in insert, you can rebind ^H to backward-character.

---------------------------

When you do a :b you should have line completion for the name.

---------------------------

How can I read the status of a shell command when I execute a
shell-command? Although the shell command has a $STATUS=1 the
status of the status variable is TRUE.

---------------------------

you can't use ! as a regular expression delimiter, as in:
	:s!pat!replace!g
because the parser treats ":s!" as if it's ":q!" or ":w!".

-------------------------

width of a region is kept in units of offset, not of columns.
i think this will break rectangular inserts of non-rectangular regions,
where the longest line may not extend to the furthest column, due to
tabs in other lines.


-------------------------

I'm using the DOS version and I prefer to use 80x28 or even higher res like
80x50 by setting set sres=80x50 in vile.rc.  The problem is that when a
command is executed with :!<shell-command> the mode switches back to 80x25.
It switches back to 80x25 permanently. I think it's acceptable that it
switches to 80x25 when it's in shell command execution.  However, technically
it should switch back to the preferred mode when it's done.

[ can anyone confirm or deny this is still true? ]
[ I don't see it happening with ibmpc.c - dickey ]

---------------------------

the borland console driver won't display the cursor on blank lines until
after you've refreshed the screen at least once, e.g. with ^L.  must
be something to do with color initialization, or something like that...

---------------------------

running a SunOS4.1.3 binary of vile on Solaris2.3 causes the "interrupted
system call" problem, no doubt due to the differing BSD/SysV signal()
semantics.  [ probable workaround:  ":set noworking" ]

----------------------

Another thing that would be really helpful would be a description of the
$debug variable, and what it does, how it works.

-------------------------------

the docs for the &right function disagree, in vile.hlp and macros.doc.  the
code seems to do what vile.hlp says.  the macros.doc behavior seems more
rational, since the current behavior can i think be duplicated more easily
with &mid than the macros.doc-style behavior.  (vile.hlp says that we take
the substring starting at the given position.  macros.doc says we take the
substring starting the given number of chars from the end.)

---------------------------------

there should be better support in vile for reading bits of shell output
into a buffer -- ":r !foo" is a little primitive when trying to insert a
single word into a line.

---------------------------------

autoindent skips blank lines when looking for the
indent value.  apparently real vi doesn't?

----------------------

currently can't pop/untag from within macro
[really?  why is this?]

------------------

are there still reentrancy problems in xvile when mousing around during
long-running operations.

----------------------

could the attribute selection logic be used to emulate vi's behavior
of replacing the last char of a change operation to '$'?  (but only for
text which does not span a line)

---------------------------

 Another problem with '1 shell-command '
 With the option '1' vile don't prompt for [Return] but the
 screen always 'hops'.  (scrolls 1 line forward and backward)

-------------------------

there should be a way to reference buffer attributes of the currently-
executing macro (or stack of macros).

-------------------------

[ how do i test this? ]
In xvile, when the load is high and the machine stalls for a while
and I key in several keystrokes ahead, it takes the first of those keystrokes
and replaces the later keys by it i.e. when several events simultaneously
arrive, it doesn't do the right thing (process them in order).

-----------------

when motion keys or pasting is used during an insertion, we should
break the insertion into multiple undoable chunks.
-----------------

pasting to a view-only buffer does not generate an error message.
----------------------------

   XVILE BUG:

      - If I click on the "maximize" gadget, it gets _really_ big.
        Like, many times bigger than the screen big; I suspect that
        it is maximizing to a number of *characters* equal to the number
        of *pixels* available or something.  If I click on the same
        gadget (after dragging that part of the window onto the screen),
        which does a normalize, it crashes.
	I am use vile 4.5 and xvile on HP/UX 9.01.
	I use vuewm as my window manager (a motif variant).

      [I would guess that the suspicion of the person reporting the bug
       is correct concerning the behavior of the window manager during
       maximization.  I don't have this problem with fvwm. pgf's changes
       to eliminate the hardcoded maximum width and height will probably
       fix the core dumps.  I'll look into seeing if there is some protocol
       which we're not observing with regard to maximization.  -kev]

------------------
      - I would like an option whereby if I have more than one file on
        the command line, the display opens with one window per buffer,
        so I can visibly see all the files available.
----------------------


if you have lines like
	123
	1234
	12
it's impossible to select them as a rectangle, since the middle line is
longest.


----------------


It would be useful to have a search that is constrained to a certain
movment.  For example, I might want to look for the string "foo" over the
next paragraph, not the whole document.  This would really be useful to
programmers who want to look for the instance of a variable or a function
call only within the current scope (or #if).

----------------
xvile:
 Is it possible to have an optional horizontal scrollbars ?
   (just for maniac users)

----------------------------

under DOS, ^P character turns on the printer.   argh.
actually, this only happens if compiled with borland.  it uses getch()
instead of intdos() to get the char.  (see ttgetc())  that's probably
at least part of the answer.

---------------
how about a mode that supports autosaving to the backup-file,
instead of to the original file -- useful for system crashes.

-----------------

rectangular operations don't work right if there are control characters
to the left of the rectangle.  (physically they work, but the visual
effect is wrong.  i'm not sure what the right thing to do is.)

-------------------------
double quote characters (and probably other special chars) are interpreted
incorrectly on the lhs of a map command.  for instance:
	map ^K" WBi"^[Ea"^[
will result in
	^K WBi
as the lhs, leaving
	^[Ea"^[
as the rhs.  the workaround is to escape the " in the lhs:
	map ^K\" WBi"^[Ea"^[

(this map surrounds the current word in double quotes)

-----------------------------

Would you please add another hook: modify-hook.  I thought this is useful,
for example, if I attempt to insert, delete (in general, modify) text
in a read-only file, I like it to prompt if the user wants to PVCS-lock it.
A message would look something like this:
	File is read-only, check out?

-----------------------------

contrary to the vile.hlp text, binding to the interrupt{} terminal
character does not fully change intrc and the user's interrupt character.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
VMS6.0 on VAXstation 4000/90.  DEC C for OpenVMS VAX compiler
version V4.0-000.  Shared library (specified in VMSSHARE.OPT)
is DECC$SHR.EXE instead of the default VAXCRTL.EXE.

symptoms:
	vile can't read vile.rc, or vile.hlp.

reason:
	on this setup, the access() library routine seems broken.
	my test program showed that it returned -1 for existant
	and non-existant files.

solution:
	I had to add a
#define HAVE_ACCESS 0
	in estruct.h (actually, I just put it in fileio.c).
[ there's a fix in estruct.h, but untested ]

-----------------------------------------------------------------

DOS:  wildcarding in the top directory:
   c:
   cd \
   vile a*.bat             (will not open autoexec.bat)
does not work, because Watcom's opendir() routine only succeeds on the root
directory if it is specified as '\'.  no other name for it seems to work.
stat won't work on it either.  (we try to open it as ".", not an unreasonable
thing to do.)

sigh.  i hate DOS.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Mips RISCos5.0 machines:
    Error: random.c, line 625: 'SIG_BLOCK' undefined, ...
    Error: random.c, line 637: 'SIG_SETMASK' undefined, ...
 [ i thought i could provide fallback definitions of those, but
   the values are different on sunos and linux, and are probably
   different again on Mips RISCos5.0, bless it's broken little heart. ]

-----------------------------------------------------------------
we should consider adding user-customizable menu or button support to
xvile:
    "Right now, you have most of the major functions as strings that can be
    called from the macro language.  Suppose you made icons or something
    for those strings, and then let the user string the icons (or maybe
    have icons trigger macros and have a set of macros for most of the
    basic stuff as a default package) together to form new icons they could
    put in some sort of icon bar.  The windows (boo!  Hiss!) users would go
    nuts!  Also, put some of this into the pull down menus, and people
    would stand to cheer and applaud. "
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I think I found a couple of very minor bugs in vile.

Possible bug #1)
I'm using xvile right now because ^S doesn't seem to work correctly in
regular vile yet (must be an HP 9.05 thing, I'm not sure yet).  I had
thought you turned flow control off in vile, but I want to do more testing
before I call this a bug.

Anyway, do this:

On a page with several lines of text, do this operation on the first one:

:s/^/> /

Now, using the mouse (or 'q'), sweep the next couple of lines.  To make
things interesting, sweep to the end of the second to last line, but
not the last line itself, so the highlighted text looks like this:

xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx

instead of

xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
x

Now, do a

^A-&-^S

On my machine, the last line of the highlighted text isn't touched.  I'm
thinking it should be...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

the command ":r !ls" should not require the space.

-----------------------------------------------------------

when using wrapmargin, it is impossible to break
up long lines consisting of a single word.

[vi doesn't do this]

-----------------------------------------------------------
	- the layering of the map code with respect to the record/replay
	  code that implements '.', the keyboard macros, and the '@'
	  command execution is severely broken.  if you have a :map
	  that executes a '@a' command in the middle, the contents
	  of register a are readied for replay, but input continues
	  to come from the :map string until it is ended, and only then
	  so we dip down to the lower level and start getting the result
	  of '@a'.  a similar thing happens with '.' used in a :map, only
	  it seems even worse, since recording isn't started/stopped
	  correctly.
	[this has been fixed for the @a case, but in a sloppy fashion.
	  it should be cleaned up.  -pgf  ]

-----------------------------

Using xvile, if I [oO]pen a
new line or do insert at the beginning of a line, and then paste in
some text using the mouse, xvile inserts an extra blank line. that is,
if I have

foo
bar

and I try to paste in 'hi' under the foo, I get

foo

hi
bar

this only seems to happen in autoindent mode at the very beginning of
the line. it does *not* happen if the preceeding line is indented, or
if I type a space before pasting.
----------------

only "reverse" works as a visual-match hilite under DOS.

---------------

a newly entered search string (even an identical one) should turn highlighting
back on

---------------

It would be nice to make the cursor invisible while doing highlighted selection,
since xterm cannot blink the cursor, and the selection has an apparent hole.
visual-match highlighting back on.  this is surprisingly hard, due to the
layering of readpattern() and kbd_reply.

---------------

While we're on the subject of bugs, let me tell you about another one that
I've long noticed when I try to insert such text.  I would like to do
:unsetl ai before pasting in the text (since I normally have auotindent
on).  But that has no effect.  Even :setall shows that autoindent is still
on.  Instead I have to do :setl noai.  Annoying.

[ i agree -- shouldn't "setl nonumber" and "unsetl number" be synonymous? -pgf]
[ I've gotten used to it as a quirk: "unsetl" deletes a flag that shadows the
  global setting.  I wish (however) that there were a nice way to highlight the
  flags that are shadowed -dickey]

---------------

running a shell command from xvile should arguably spawn a new xterm.  it
should certainly do it in a new window.

---------------

vile trims all trailing whitespace when user inserts a space that triggers
wrapmargin, vi trims only the whitespace inserted during the current command.
[ i'm not sure i consider this a bug.  vile plays loose with whitespace
in many such situations.  if you're using wrapmargin, you're probably
not worried about trailing whitespace anyway.  -- pgf ]

---------------

I just rediscovered a small problem with the :<number> command
to go to a certain line number. Try:

        <esc>:a<backspace>1<return>

This is not accepted by vile. You have to type <esc>:1 to recover. I am
running under SunOS 4.1.2.

[ this is very difficult to fix.  -pgf ]

--------------------------

This is a report against vile v5.4 built using djgpp.  Vile is running
in raw DOS (not in a Windows DOS box).

This command:
    vile -4
gives me 50 lines (not 43).  The only two screen resolutions that seem
to work are vile -2 and vile -5 .

[ This is a result of the borland screen library.  43 lines are available
under OS/2... ]

---------------------------------
.. you can't use the mouse to select text from the command input line, I often
use this after Ctrl+G to get the filename for a UNIX command elsewhere.

---------------------------------
.. button 1 selection doesn't work it quite the same way as other apps. e.g.
in xterm, double click on a word (don't release button after second click)
and drag along a sentence - first word is selected and so are subsequent
words in the sentence as you drag.  Just the first word is selected in xvile.

---------------------------------

link problems:  vile or xvile has link problems on:
	- Openlook on sunos4.1.3
 	- SCO OpenServer 5.0 (needed -lsocket, and needed different
		lib ordering for -lXt and -lXm for the motif version.
	- BSD/OS 2.0.1 (X11R6) -- needed this order: -lXt -lXM -lICE -lX11
	- IRIX 5.2 -- drop the '-lnsl' library

---------------------------------

vile 5.5 almost passed my macro test with only small cosmetic problem:

;    !@  --mapto-->  replace "Unixcommand!@" with "Unixcommand" output
map! !@ ^V^M^[bi:r !^[F:"adt@mm@ais^["bd$dd`m@b
;    #@  --mapto-->  replace "@Unixcommand args#@" with "Unixcommand" output
map! #@ ^V^M^[F@s:r !^[F:"adt@mm@ais^["bd$dd`m@b

Both now produce correct results.  But the final status message doesn't
make sense:  Delete operation pending...  when it actually in insert
mode.  Fortunately, there is a workaround, set terse.  it would be nice
if vile can temporary set terse before executing macros and reset back
to original mode afterwards. Sounds easy?

------------------------

there are two conflicting wordwrap mechanisms in vile --
	- the historical wrapwords setting, inherited from
	  microemacs, will wrap words in input mode when you type a
	  space character after you've passed the "fillcol" column.
	- the vi-like "wrapmargin" setting sets the column past which
	  entering more input will cause a line break.

i think we should eliminate the historical mechanism in favor of the vi-ish
one, and i've marked it [deprecated] in vile.hlp.  (as of version 5.6)
vim has a "textwidth" mode, which functions exactly like wrapmargin, except
that it is measured from the left.  this prevents line length from changing
when the screen is resized, a drawback of wrapmargin.  i propose eliminating
fillcol, and introducing textwidth.

--------------------------------------

It would be nice to have a 'smart' shiftwidth, that would jump back
to the indent level of the first previous line with a different
indent level. What I mean is:

aaa aa aa aaa aaa a
    - bb bbb bb bb bb b
      ccc cc cc cc c
      <control-d>

where <control-d> would jump back to the indent level of the minus sign.
I encountered this behaviour with the 'EDIT' program on MS-DOS with
the backspace key. It's really quite convenient, although I am not so
sure it is smart to put both the 'shift-back' and 'backspace' behaviour
under the same key.

------------------------

The 'qsort' function in Watcom 10.0a for MS-DOS is broken (file-completion
hangs, probably due to stack overflow).

OS/2 version built with Watcom 10.0a does not open pipes successfully.  Also it
does not do function keys.

------------------------
given a :map! of:
    map! #9 foobar
then when Fn-9 is pressed in insert mode, you get "foobar" in the buffer.
if you manually insert "#9", no translation is done.  BUT, if you repeat
that insert by typing '.', then you'll get "foobar".  (i.e. "i#9<ESC>." )

------------------------


when a buffer is out of date wrt its file (i.e. you have been warned but
you answered 'n') it should say something like [out-of-date] on the modeline.
this should be true whether or not "check-modtimes" is on.  in fact, in
retrospect, "check-modtimes" should really be "warn-out-of-date", or
something like that, and we should _always_ check modification times.

---------------------

Not sure if this will be generally useful, but I changed the tags.c
module to use "_qident" instead of "_ident" in the gototag() function.
This allows a user to goto C++ functions when the tag is a C++
class::function reference.

------------"
    How about changing makefile.djg, adding a line like
      strip vile
    just before the call to coff2exe.  This will reduce the
    size of the djgpp executable from 1,328,037 bytes (with
    djgpp 1.12 patch 4) to 259,072 bytes.  Just a little idea.
[i'll add a different target instead...]


-----------------------------

add a copyright to the binary

------------------
The configure script returns the wrong value for HAVE_SYS_FILIO_H on
OSF/1-Alpha; termio.c doesn't compile with that problem.

also, the configure script returns the wrong value for GETPGRP_HAS_ARG on the
OSF/1-Alpha.

The test in configure compiles ok with "cc" but not with gcc.
ac_compile in configure uses cc as a default. This may be able
to be worked around by setting $CC to gcc before running
configure.


The install program is also much touchier about argument order; the
directory must follow -c argument.

Here's a partial diff which I think shows part of what must be done:

*** makefile.orig       Thu Feb 15 11:56:40 1996
--- makefile    Thu Feb 15 11:56:41 1996

        $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) vile-manfilt $@
  $(bindir)/vile-c-filt:     vile-c-filt


But on the other hand, it also doesn't want the final name of the
binary in the path mentioned (bad: /usr/local/bin/vile; good: /usr/local/bin/);
I don't know enough make magic to get the basename stripped off. Perhaps
the "$@" should just be $(bindir).


------------"
Another point of irritation is the autoindent behaviour when inserting
blank lines; where vi will continue with a reduced indent after typing a
CTRL-D, vile insists on keeping the indent on par with the last non-empty
line.  (^^D is inteneded to be temporary, 0^D should be permanent, even if
what you've entered is a blank line.  don't know about simple ^D.)

-------------------------

There's another thought for you, if I have a file, say 1000
lines and at some point in the middle (say line 500), I enter
the command ":1,w file1", it doesn't work.  In 'vi' it works
fine but vile can't do it.  There's two errors in the line
according to vile, the first is without saying ":1,.w", vile
doesn't default to the current line (vi says this is valid)
and then, the space after the "w" causes vile to say "invalid
line specification".  HOWEVER!  Doing ":,$w file2" works fine,
so vile DOES recognize that the unstated line number before
the comma is the current line.

------------------------------

vile should accept a single line number as implying that line only.  Every
version of vi I've ever used takes
  :.w /tmp/dans
or
  :206w /tmp/dans
to mean "write just exactly one line to /tmp/dans".
----------------------


file completion doesn't work in the presence of directories which match
a substring of other files or directories.  that is:
	:!mkdir foo
	:!mkdir food
	:!mkdir fool
	:e foo<TAB>
yields:
	:e foo/
instead of also providing "food" and "fool" as choices.  with the same
setup, the following:
	:e food<TAB>
yields:
	:e food/
instead of also providing "fool".

------------------------

I think there is a bug for th motif version of VILE. If I have two
windows opened, I drag the resize button with my mouse to resize the top
window. When the bottom window become too small, the two windows just
simply disappear and become one window. The other versions (X11 and
Plain) don't collapse windows. They will leave one line for the bottom
window and display a message saying "Impossible change".

------------

When the various DOS/Windoze) .zip files are created, it would be nice if
they included a formatted version of the man page ('cuz DOS/Windoze doesn't
have nroff :-) ).
-----------

	I'm using vile 5.6 on Unix and I'm wondering if you could add to
the next release of vile a method of bringing up a permanent list of
buffers automatically on startup i.e.  execute the show-buffers command on
startup.  [I realise that you haven't fully implemented the + command line
option in vile ]

------------
using '&' in pc-vile as the word-expansion replacement for ':' in regular
vile may someday conflict if we want to spawn stuff in the background
in VMS or win32 vile.  clearly the expansion chars should be made
selectable.  not a big deal yet....

------------------

Global "cmode" is on.  Edit a new (empty) buffer.  "cmode" is off for that
buffer.  Do a ":unsetl cmode".  This should have no affect.  What it actually
does is turn "cmode" on!

-----------------

"visual-matches" mode should be conditional on file size, or perhaps
on time taken to do the search...

-----------------

These are old wishes/bugs:

	set-dos, write file, doesn't reflect (in chars-written message) the
	added ^M's on each line.

	not every system declares the struct-type for utime/utimes.

	make partial-completion in [History] set DOT to the current line
	we're matching from, if [History] is visible.

	make vile know about different types of tags-files (ctags -s, etags),

	on VMS, elvis writes files with stmlf-cr format.  vile writes files
	with var-cr format.  the former is a little smaller.  vile ought to
	remember the input file's format to use in writing new files (if
	possible).

These date back to 5.4:

	+ correct :.,$<bs> lockup

	+ should next_column() use HIGHBIT test?

	+ ':' expansion doesn't work with ":write-file" because DOT is
	  commandeered for use in a region.

	+ should allow '$' in identifiers (or make it an option), and modify
	  'tags' to correspond

These are pre-6.0 (undated)

	use CSet C/C++ to flush out unsigned stuff, especially flags that
	ought to be.

	add configure-test for 'ospeed'

	implement gpm

	vi sets '#' on attempted write; vile doesn't

	split-out ctype.c, use locale to determine isprint, etc.

	fix the ^VNNN to show digits

-- 96-10-23 (Alex Wetmore <awetmore@microsoft.com>)

	I've made some changes to vile that I wanted to discuss:

	The biggest one is allowing vile-commands to be replaced with vile
	procedures.  I did this so that I could make split-current-window (:sp)
	have the same finger feel and nvi (which allows you do a :sp <filename>
	to edit a filename).  There are two problems with my implementation
	that I wanted to discuss:

	* one is that it requires that the procedure have exactly the same name
	as the command.  it would be nice to be able to add new : commands by
	just making procedures.  the largest problem with this is that the
	commands are looked up every time that you hit a key via a binary
	search.  with a linear search they could be changed to go through
	procedures as well, but this would slow things down.  also it would be
	necessary to have a method to say which procedures should become : 
	commands.

	* the other is that there is no way to let the procedure know if they
	were called via space or enter.  for instance with the
	split-current-window example i gave above I am using the following
	macro:

	store-procedure split-current-window
		split-current-window
		set-variable %filename @"file: "
		~if &gre &len %filename 0
			edit-file %filename
		~else
			write-message ""
		~endif
	~endm

	This means that if I want to split the current window without editting
	another file that I need to type <:> <s> <p> <enter> <enter>.  On nvi
	it would just be <:> <s> <p> <enter>.

	The problem is that there are no standards for passing arguments into
	stored-procedures in vile (that I've found out about at least) so there
	isn't really a good way to let the procedure know how it was invoked. 
	I could add a new variable that it could look up I suppose.

	I think that adding this feature (the ability to rewrite :  commands
	and add new ones) would do a lot to make vile more modifiable.  For
	instance it would be great to be able to add little commands like :grep
	that do a grep into a new window (I know I can bind it to a key, but a
	:  command seems like a better way to do it to me).

	So, any ideas for how to modify the command searching engine to look
	for these macros and how to register these macros?  I'm willing to do
	the work and submit my diffs back into a future version of vile.

-- 96-10-25 (Anand Mandapati <anand@ibmoto.com>)

	The behavior of 'yq' doesn't seem to match the behavior of other quoted
	motion operations.  Here are some sample scenarios:

	    I) Yank a single line NOT including the eol, ie, like 'y$'
	       1. I type 'yq$q' to yank the line all the way to the eol but
		  don't want to include the eol.
	       2. I then do a 'P' to put this yanked text before the cursor.
	       3. It behaves as 'y$P' would.

	    II) Yank a single line including the eol, ie, like 'yy'
	       1. I type 'yqjq' to yank the line all the way to the eol and
		  want to include the eol in the selection.
	       2. I then do a 'P' to put this yanked text before the cursor.
	       3. It behaves as 'y$P' would, not as 'yyp' would.

	At first I thought maybe this is the expected behavior, but if I use
	'c' to change the same selections instead of yank, the behavior seems
	different.  Let me clarify:

	    I) Change a single line NOT including the eol, ie, like 'c$'
	       1. I type 'cq$q' to change the line all the way to the eol but
		  don't want to include the eol.
	       2. This deletes all the way to the end of the line and I can
		  now type like normal.

	    II) Change a single line including the eol (no equiv. in vi?)
	       1. I type 'cqjq' to change the line all the way to the eol and
		  want to include the eol in the deletion.
	       2. This deletes the entire line including the eol, shifts the
		  next line up to the cursor and I can now type the replacement
		  text.

	The behavior for 'd' and other quoted-motion operations is similar.
	The 'yq' behavior doesn't seem logical.  Do I just not understand it
	correctly?

	I am trying to get vile on nt or xvile on an rs6000 workstation to
	colorize perl syntax.  I use the color_readhook macro and the perl
	filter.  Now both on the PC and xvile I can get vile to use italics,
	but I can not get it to use color just bold face.  For xvile I defined
	in the .Xdefaults and .Xresources file the following:

		XVile.color.fcolor1: red
		XVile.color.fcolor2: green
		etc

	and then used xrdb to read in the new .Xdefaults or .Xresources file
	but no luck.  Xvile compiler just like a charm.  Do I have to
	(re)compile xvile with different switches?

	On nt I can set the forground and background color with the set
	commands.  In xvile I can control the fore/background cursor etc colors
	through the .Xdefaults or the command line switches.  So on both
	systems I am able to get fore/background color, but I cann't get the
	color attributes to work.  Only the boldface and italics attributes
	work.  Do the color attributes only work with certain fonts or are the
